A file uploader is\ncommonly found in forms, but can also live as a standalone element. There are\ntwo variants of file uploaders—our default file uploader and a drag and drop\nfile uploader.\n\n### Variants\n\n| Variant                                                     | Way it works                                                                                |\n| ----------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| [File uploader](#file-uploader)                             | Upload one or more files by clicking an action button that prompts a file selection dialog. |\n| [Drag and drop file uploader](#drag-and-drop-file-uploader) | Drag and drop selected files directly into a drop zone area to upload.                      |\n\n### When to use\n\n- Uploading one or more files.\n- Uploading files by dragging and dropping.\n- Showing the process of uploading.\n\n### When not to use\n\n- Do not use upload in a modal when multiple files are uploaded, as uploaded\n  files stack vertically.\n\n## Live demo\n\n<StorybookDemo\n  themeSelector\n  url=\"https://react.carbondesignsystem.com\"\n  variants={[\n    {\n      label: 'Default',\n      variant: 'components-fileuploader--default',\n    },\n    {\n      label: 'File Uploader Drop Container',\n      variant: 'components-fileuploader--file-uploader-drop-container',\n    },\n  ]}\n/>\n\n## Formatting\n\n### Anatomy\n\n<Row>\n<Column colLg={8}>\n\n![File uploader anatomy](images/file-uploader-usage-1.png)\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\n1. **Heading:** Text to describe the upload section.\n2. **Description:** Text to help the user make an informed selection.\n3. **Button or drop zone label:** The action to select a file to upload.\n4. **Uploaded file:** A file that has successfully been uploaded.\n5. **x:** The delete `x` icon will remove the uploaded file.\n\n### Sizing\n\nThe button and uploaded files should be the same height.

Alternatively, you can also traditionally\nopen files through a file selection dialog by clicking the text link description\ninside the drop zone.\n\nThe drop zone component lets users upload files by dragging and dropping the\nfiles into an area on a page, or activating a button.\n\n<Row>\n<Column colLg={12}>\n\n![File uploader in context example](images/file-uploader-usage-10a.png)\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\nWhen dragging files into the drop zone area, the drop zone border changes in\ncolor and thickness to indicate the area has been activated and is ready for\nfiles.
