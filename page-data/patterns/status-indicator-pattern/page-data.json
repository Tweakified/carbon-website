Often, the indicator will denote that there has been\na change to a particular item. They are frequently used to signal validation\nerrors or notifications, changes, or updates. They can also be used on their\nown. Indicators are visual cues intended to attract the user's attention to a\npiece of content or UI element that is dynamic in nature.\n\nIn this pattern we explore:\n\n- Choosing the best status indicators for your context\n- The different status indicator variants\n- What elements they are comprised of and how each element works to communicate\n\n## Choosing for context\n\nIn the UI landscape, examples of status indicators are everywhere. However this\npattern will focus less on the components or patterns in which indicators tend\nto appear (notifications, inline errors, dashboards, and so on) and more on the\nurgency of the communication.\n\nFor ease of use, status indicators can be classified into levels of severity\nsuch as high, medium, and low attention. See more information on choosing\nbetween alias icons and outlined versus filled icons in the\n[Status shapes](#status-shapes) section below.\n\n#### Consolidated statuses\n\nWhen multiple statuses are consolidated, use the highest-attention color to\nrepresent the group. For example, if the statuses of underlying components are\ngreen, yellow, and red, the consolidated indicator is red.\n\n#### Cognitive load\n\nDon't use status indicators when no user action is necessary and status\ninformation is not important enough to highlight. Use plain text instead to\navoid the overuse of status indicators. While we won’t go as far a prescribing a\nmaximum number, more than 5 or 6 indicators begins to tax a user and makes it\ndifficult to focus.\n\n### High attention\n\nThese indicators signal that user action is needed immediately—that is, there is\nan irregularity in the system, something malfunctioned, or a user needs to\nconfirm a potentially destructive action. Some examples include alerts,\nexceptions, confirmations, and errors.\n\n<StatusIndicatorTable attention=\"high\" />\n\n### Medium attention\n\nUse these indicators when no immediate user action is required or to provide\nfeedback to a user action. Some examples include acknowledgements and progress\nindicators.\n\n<StatusIndicatorTable attention=\"medium\" />\n\n### Low attention\n\nUse these indicators when something is ready to view, for system feedback, or to\nsignify that something has changed since the last interaction. Some examples\ninclude tooltip triggers that offer explanatory or added information, and\npassive notifications.\n\n<StatusIndicatorTable attention=\"low\" />\n\n## Ingredients\n\nTo communicate their message, indicators can take many forms—they're not\nconfined to iconography. There are four basic elements that comprise Carbon\nstatus indicators. (Note: we won't get into animation and sound in this\npattern.) And for WCAG compliance, at least three of these elements must be\npresent. Let's look at these elements more closely before examining specific\nstatus types.\n\n- Symbols\n- Shapes\n- Colors\n- Type\n\n### Status icons\n\nIcons are visual symbols used to represent ideas, objects, or actions. Ideally,\nthey communicate messages at a glance, afford interactivity, and draw attention\nto important information. For example, using exclamation points for warnings,\ncheckmarks for success, and question marks for help or unknown.\n\nTo standardize the icons that are used most widely in IBM product, we’ve\nincluded only the most universally recognized icons. Certain products may have\ncertain modifications or most robust sets.\n\n<Row>\n<Column colLg={8}>\n\n![Examples of common status icons.](./images/status_indicator_1.png)\n\n<Caption>Examples of some of the most common status symbols</Caption>\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\n### Status shapes\n\nIn this context, shapes refer to geometric figures like squares, circles,\nrectangles, and so on, as they are instantly readable even at small sizes. These\nshapes have strong visual associations that can be applied to help users succeed\nin using their product flows. For instance, shapes with straight lines and 90\ndegree angles usually convey structure and order—like the grid. While shapes\nwith curves are friendlier and symbolize continuity and connection.\n\nThere can also be cultural associations connected with shapes. For example in\ntraffic and wayfinding, hexagons mean stop, and upside triangles means yield.\nUsing shapes incorrectly can disturb learned recognition patterns and confuse\nusers, possibly hurting their overall experience.\n\n<Row>\n<Column colLg={8}>\n\n![A circle, a square, a diamond, a triangle and a hexagon](./images/status_indicator_2.png)\n\n<Caption>Example of the most common status shapes</Caption>\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\n#### Outline versus filled shapes\n\nWe offer two options that can be flexible for usage based on your team's\npreference. Keep in mind that filled icons are more visible and tend to carry\nmore weight, therefore they’re often used for high attention statuses. Outlined\nicons are more delicate and not as readily scannable.\n\nIn addition, the more line work an icon has—and the more breaks in those\nlines—the more difficult it is to use a filled icon. For this reason, some\nproduct teams may occasionally mix in an outline icon with a filled icon. This\nis okay but for the most part, designers should try to be consistent throughout\nthe product or application. At the very least, designers should avoid mixing\noutlined and filled indicators on the same page.\n\n#### Alias status icons\n\nIn several cases, we offer multiple shape options for one type of status\nindicator. For example, ‘warning’ ‘help’ and ‘information’ status icons have\nmultiple variants to convey similar or exactly the same information. Often\ntimes, users of certain products have grown accustomed to say, a hexagon instead\nof a circle to convey a critical warning. Or a team perhaps wants to go the\nextra mile and offer yet another differentiator for accessibility. Although\nconsistency is always the goal, there’s no need to avoid differentiation to\naccomodate user preferences. Whichever style you choose however, avoid mixing\nthroughout the UI.\n\nIf an alias that your product frequently uses has been removed from the set and\nyou can make a case for the importance of including it here, please let us know.\n\n### Status palette\n\nThe status palette includes all of the colors that can be used to reflect\nstatus. Typically, red represents danger or error, orange represents a serious\nwarning, yellow represents a regular warning, green represents normal or\nsuccess, and blue represents passive notifications, usually involving additional\ninformation and workflow progress. We’ve also included gray and purple to add\nmore depth to the system. Gray indicates drafts or jobs that haven’t been\nstarted, and purple indicates outliers or undefined statuses.\n\n<ColorPalette twoColumn type=\"status\" />\n\n#### Extended status palettes\n\nThis palette is only for added contrast accessibility when using yellows and\noranges. It’s not a part of the IBM brand palette and it’s also not included in\nthe v2 color release (that is, it’s not in ASE, Sketch kit palettes, and so on)\nbecause it’s for very selective use in data visualizations and certain status\nindicators. Do not use this palette in any other manner in your layouts.\n\n<ColorPalette type=\"status-extended\" shouldShowControls={false} />\n\n## Variants\n\nThere are at least four possible ways to implement status indicators:\n\n- Icon indicators\n- Badge indicators (with and without numbers)\n- Shape indicators\n- Differential indicators\n\n| Variant                           | Usage                                                                                                                                                                     | Context                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |\n| --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| Icon indicators                   | Used any time the layout offers ample space and the content requires maximum attention. They require an icon, a shape, a meaningful color and a descriptive inline label. | Icon indicators are widely used in [Notifications](/components/notification/usage), [Progress indicators](/components/progress-indicator/usage), [Data tables](/components/data-table/usage), task lists and dashboard widgets. |\n| Badge indicators (with number)    | Useful when a count of new or updated items is available, and it is important for the user to know the number of updates.                                                 | Most often used in notification panes in the header, and used in conjunction with avatars or icons.                                                                                                                             |\n| Badge indicators (without number) | Useful when new or updated items are available and the number of notifications is unknown or irrelevant to the user. The dot badge is also more compact and discrete.     | Most often used in notification panes in the header, and used in conjuntion with avatars or icons.                                                                                                                              |\n| Shape indicators                  | Useful in smaller spaces or when users need to scan large amount of data.                                                                                                 | Most often used in lists, dashboards, data tables, data visualizations, and network diagrams.                                                                                                                                   |\n| Differential indicators           | Useful when users are monitoring differentials in large lists of statistics and when anything other than type would be too obtrusive.                                     | Most often used in financial dashboards for highlighting deltas or other types of data visualizations.                                                                                                                          |\n\n### Anatomy\n\nLike a button, a status indicator’s text label is the most important element, as\nit communicates progress. By default, Carbon uses sentence case for all button\nlabels.\n\nText labels, column labels (or a legend, when inline labels aren’t an option)\nare strongly recommended.\n\n<Row>\n<Column colLg={8}>\n\n![Anatomy images of the five types of status indicators](./images/status_indicator_3.png)\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\n<Row>\n<Column colSm={2} colMd={4} colLg={4}>\n\n#### 1.

Easily recognizable icons can make very effective communication tools and\ngreatly improve scannability, especially with large amounts of content. Icon\nindicators are widely used in notifications, progress indicators, data tables,\ntask lists and dashboard widgets.\n\n<Row>\n<Column colLg={8}>\n\n![Carbon notification component](./images/status_indicator_4.png)\n\n<Caption>\n  Notifications are the most prevalent example of this type of status indicator.\n</Caption>\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\n#### Type pairing and alignment\n\nIcon indicators are sometimes referred to as ‘contextual’ status indicators as\nwell because they are associated with a UI element or with a piece of content.\nAs such they should be shown in close proximity to that element.\n\nThere are also cases, especially in data tables and lists, where the column\nheading or row label may provide context that is additive to the inline label.\nWhen very common ‘stop light’ associations are present, as in the following\nexample, it may not be necessary to explicitly label an icon as ‘warning,’ or\n‘stable’ — as these interpretations are widely understood in product. However it\nis good practice to clarify the status intention in the text label.\n\n<DoDontRow>\n  <DoDont type=\"do\" caption=\"Do left align icons and type in lists and data tables, regardless of whether you’re using the responsive grid or spacers.\" colLg={6}>\n\n![Aligned status indicator icons.](images/status_indicator_5.png)\n\n  </DoDont>\n  <DoDont type=\"dont\" colLg={6} caption=\"Do not push icons out of alignment with label length. In this case, where the status indicators are flush right, the two digit labels are pushing the icons out of alignment.\">\n\n![Misaligned status indicator icons](images/status_indicator_6.png)\n\n  </DoDont>\n</DoDontRow>\n\n### Badge indicators\n\nBadge indicators let the user know that something is new or updated. A badge\nstatus is displayed over a ghost icon button, usually in the header, to indicate\nan active notification and is cleared after the user acknowledges the\nnotification. Depending on your use case, the icon button can open a new page or\nlaunch a modal, pane, or flyout.\n\n<Row>\n<Column colLg={8}>\n\n![Example of badge indicators in a global header](./images/status_indicator_7.png)\n\n<Caption>\n  Badge statuses with numbers are usually used for global notifications.\n</Caption>\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\n#### Badge status with number\n\nNumbers are used in conjunction with a badge status when a count of new or\nupdated items is available and it's important for the user to know the number of\nupdates.\n\nBadge status numbers can only be used in conjunction with the large icon button\nbecause with anything smaller, the icon gets covered. In very rare cases badge\nnumber may exceed two digits.\n\n<Row>\n<Column colLg={8}>\n\n![Four icons with badges that included numbers ranging from one to three digits. The last badge has a plus.](./images/badge-status-with-number.jpg)\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\n#### Badge status without number\n\nA badge indicator with no number is used when a new notification is available\nand the number of notifications is either unknown or irrelevant to the user. The\ndot badge is less noticeable than the numbered badge, but still draws the user’s\nattention to the icon button.\n\n### Shape indicators\n\nShape indicators combine color shape and text to create a standard and\nconsistent way to indicate the status of a device, feature, or version. Icons\nare not present. These shapes are also seen in certain diagrams and data\nvisualizations, for example network diagrams.\n\nThe shapes are only the most basic geometries, derived from the larger icon\ncontainers, so they can be easily discerned at small sizes. Shape indicators are\nnot available in outline because they are so small. The only situations in which\nyou would use an outline is to ensure contrast accessibility for yellows or\noranges in the Carbon light themes.\n\nThe table below is a first pass at establishing a standard lexicon for symbol\nindicators across IBM products.\n\n#### Same shape, different color\n\nThe status shapes naturally allow more room for interpretation than the status\nicons. Certain shapes can take on different colors for different circumstances.\nHowever, NEVER use the same shape, in different colors, within the same\nexperience.\n\n<StatusIndicatorTable attention=\"glyph\" />\n\n#### Type pairing and alignment\n\nShape indicators are also ‘contextual’ status indicators. Like the status icons\nabove, assets have been created for the shape indicators that take into account\noptical alignment. Do not attempt to create these shapes yourself. Use the\napproved shape indicator provided for you in the icon library.\n\nAs with the icons, choose the appropriate canvas size depending on the size of\nthe status label with which it is paired. 16px symbols are optimized to feel\nbalanced when paired with both 12px and 14px IBM Plex. Since shape indicators\nare most often reserved for small usage scenarios in product, we would advise\nyou to use full status indicators with 16px IBM Plex.\n\n<Row>\n<Column colLg={8}>\n\n![IBM Plex type and shape indicator pairing example](./images/status_indicator_8.png)\n\n<Caption>\n  Shape status canvases should be placed 4px from the beginning of the text box.\n</Caption>\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\n<Row>\n<Column colLg={8}>\n\n![Example of a contextual shape status indicator](./images/status_indicator_9.png)\n\n<Caption>Example of the status label directly next to the shape</Caption>\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\n#### Legends\n\nBecause shape indicators don’t have the added recognition of an icon, it’s even\nmore important that they are paired with a status label. Alternately, the\ndesigner can provide the user with a legend if a status label isn’t an option.\n\n<Row>\n<Column colLg={8}>\n\n![Example of a legend paired with a shape indicator](./images/status_indicator_10.png)\n\n<Caption>\n  Example where the status symbol indicator depends on the legend at the top of\n  the page\n</Caption>\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\n<Title>Best practices</Title>\n\n<DoDontRow>\n<DoDont\ntype=\"do\"\ncaption=\"Do place shape indicators before labels; they can be placed after other text only if there is no character count variation.\">\n\n![Do place shape indicators before labels; they can be placed after other text only if there is no character count variation.](./images/status_indicator_11.png)\n\n</DoDont>\n\n<DoDont\ntype=\"dont\"\ncaption=\"Do not place shape indicators after the labels to avoid pushing them out of alignment.\">\n\n![Do not place shape indicators after the labels to avoid pushing them out of alignment](./images/status_indicator_12.png)\n\n</DoDont>\n</DoDontRow>\n\n<DoDontRow>\n<DoDont\ntype=\"do\"\ncaption=\"Do use shape, color, and status labels to improve scannability.\">\n\n![Do use shape, color, and status labels to improve scannability.](./images/status_indicator_13.png)\n\n</DoDont>\n\n<DoDont\ntype=\"dont\"\ncaption=\"Avoid using only color and status labels to differentiate your content.\">\n\n![Avoid using only color and status labels to differentiate your content.](./images/status_indicator_14.png)\n\n</DoDont>\n</DoDontRow>\n\n### Differential indicators\n\nDifferential indicators often help users understand the movement or changes in\ninformation. They are especially useful when users are monitoring differences in\nlarge lists of statistics and anything other than type would be too obtrusive.\nExamples include the common convention of color-coding stock symbols in an\ninvestment account if their price has changed substantially. Designers also rely\non them to highlight deltas in data visualizations.\n\nAlthough typographic indicators can be used without an icon as long as a minus\nor a plus sign is used, they are most often paired with arrow or caret icons in\nour system.\n\n<Row>\n<Column colLg={8}>\n\n![Caret and arrow icons](./images/status_indicator_16.png)\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\n#### Color\n\nDifferential indicators are either displaying a positive or a negative value.\nColor is optional in these situations as long as the value has either a ‘+’ or\n‘-’ in front of it, a chevron icon, or an arrow icon. Unless the data involves\ntemperature, positive values are represented by the green spectrum and negative\nvalues are represented by the red spectrum.\n\n<Row>\n<Column colLg={8}>\n\n![Examples of differential indicators](./images/status_indicator_15.png)\n\n<Caption>Differential indicators are most often seen in dashboards.</Caption>\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\n## Accessibility\n\nAccessible design not only helps users with disabilities, it provides better\nuser experiences for everyone. The most common form of color blindness is\nred/green color blindness. The inability for some users to distinguish between\nred and green means that products cannot simply rely on color to show status. As\na result, the status system relies on three key elements; color, shape, and\nsymbol.\n\nFor example, the critical icon is not just “red”, it is the sum of the following\nelements.\n\nColor = Red <br /> Shape = Circle <br /> Symbol = \\ <br /> Text = Critical\n\n<br />\n\n<DoDontRow>\n  <DoDont type=\"do\" caption=\"Do include at least three out of four indicators of status to meet accessibility requirements.\" colLg={6}>\n\n![Example of accessible status indicators](images/status_indicator_17.png)\n\n  </DoDont>\n  <DoDont type=\"dont\" colLg={6} caption=\"Avoid designs with less than three indicators of status; using solely color and symbols is inaccessible.\">\n\n![Example of inaccessible status indicators](images/status_indicator_18.png)\n\n  </DoDont>\n</DoDontRow>\n\n### Status notifications\n\n#### Don’t use notifications that dismiss on a timer for critical or emergency messages.\n\nSome users with disabilities need more time to read or interact with messages\nand timed toasts may not provide sufficient time. WCAG 2.1 success criterion\n2.2.4 (AAA)\n\n#### Users should be able to manage or limit non-critical notifications.\n\nThis gives users the control to reduce the number of distractions or disruptions\nthey receive, which is particularly helpful for users with cognitive\nlimitations.

Often, the indicator will denote that there has been\na change to a particular item. They are frequently used to signal validation\nerrors or notifications, changes, or updates. They can also be used on their\nown. Indicators are visual cues intended to attract the user's attention to a\npiece of content or UI element that is dynamic in nature.\n\nIn this pattern we explore:\n\n- Choosing the best status indicators for your context\n- The different status indicator variants\n- What elements they are comprised of and how each element works to communicate\n\n## Choosing for context\n\nIn the UI landscape, examples of status indicators are everywhere. However this\npattern will focus less on the components or patterns in which indicators tend\nto appear (notifications, inline errors, dashboards, and so on) and more on the\nurgency of the communication.\n\nFor ease of use, status indicators can be classified into levels of severity\nsuch as high, medium, and low attention. See more information on choosing\nbetween alias icons and outlined versus filled icons in the\n[Status shapes](#status-shapes) section below.\n\n#### Consolidated statuses\n\nWhen multiple statuses are consolidated, use the highest-attention color to\nrepresent the group. For example, if the statuses of underlying components are\ngreen, yellow, and red, the consolidated indicator is red.\n\n#### Cognitive load\n\nDon't use status indicators when no user action is necessary and status\ninformation is not important enough to highlight. Use plain text instead to\navoid the overuse of status indicators. While we won’t go as far a prescribing a\nmaximum number, more than 5 or 6 indicators begins to tax a user and makes it\ndifficult to focus.\n\n### High attention\n\nThese indicators signal that user action is needed immediately—that is, there is\nan irregularity in the system, something malfunctioned, or a user needs to\nconfirm a potentially destructive action. Some examples include alerts,\nexceptions, confirmations, and errors.\n\n<StatusIndicatorTable attention=\"high\" />\n\n### Medium attention\n\nUse these indicators when no immediate user action is required or to provide\nfeedback to a user action. Some examples include acknowledgements and progress\nindicators.\n\n<StatusIndicatorTable attention=\"medium\" />\n\n### Low attention\n\nUse these indicators when something is ready to view, for system feedback, or to\nsignify that something has changed since the last interaction. Some examples\ninclude tooltip triggers that offer explanatory or added information, and\npassive notifications.\n\n<StatusIndicatorTable attention=\"low\" />\n\n## Ingredients\n\nTo communicate their message, indicators can take many forms—they're not\nconfined to iconography. There are four basic elements that comprise Carbon\nstatus indicators. (Note: we won't get into animation and sound in this\npattern.) And for WCAG compliance, at least three of these elements must be\npresent. Let's look at these elements more closely before examining specific\nstatus types.\n\n- Symbols\n- Shapes\n- Colors\n- Type\n\n### Status icons\n\nIcons are visual symbols used to represent ideas, objects, or actions. Ideally,\nthey communicate messages at a glance, afford interactivity, and draw attention\nto important information. For example, using exclamation points for warnings,\ncheckmarks for success, and question marks for help or unknown.\n\nTo standardize the icons that are used most widely in IBM product, we’ve\nincluded only the most universally recognized icons. Certain products may have\ncertain modifications or most robust sets.\n\n<Row>\n<Column colLg={8}>\n\n![Examples of common status icons.](./images/status_indicator_1.png)\n\n<Caption>Examples of some of the most common status symbols</Caption>\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\n### Status shapes\n\nIn this context, shapes refer to geometric figures like squares, circles,\nrectangles, and so on, as they are instantly readable even at small sizes. These\nshapes have strong visual associations that can be applied to help users succeed\nin using their product flows. For instance, shapes with straight lines and 90\ndegree angles usually convey structure and order—like the grid. While shapes\nwith curves are friendlier and symbolize continuity and connection.\n\nThere can also be cultural associations connected with shapes. For example in\ntraffic and wayfinding, hexagons mean stop, and upside triangles means yield.\nUsing shapes incorrectly can disturb learned recognition patterns and confuse\nusers, possibly hurting their overall experience.\n\n<Row>\n<Column colLg={8}>\n\n![A circle, a square, a diamond, a triangle and a hexagon](./images/status_indicator_2.png)\n\n<Caption>Example of the most common status shapes</Caption>\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\n#### Outline versus filled shapes\n\nWe offer two options that can be flexible for usage based on your team's\npreference. Keep in mind that filled icons are more visible and tend to carry\nmore weight, therefore they’re often used for high attention statuses. Outlined\nicons are more delicate and not as readily scannable.\n\nIn addition, the more line work an icon has—and the more breaks in those\nlines—the more difficult it is to use a filled icon. For this reason, some\nproduct teams may occasionally mix in an outline icon with a filled icon. This\nis okay but for the most part, designers should try to be consistent throughout\nthe product or application. At the very least, designers should avoid mixing\noutlined and filled indicators on the same page.\n\n#### Alias status icons\n\nIn several cases, we offer multiple shape options for one type of status\nindicator. For example, ‘warning’ ‘help’ and ‘information’ status icons have\nmultiple variants to convey similar or exactly the same information. Often\ntimes, users of certain products have grown accustomed to say, a hexagon instead\nof a circle to convey a critical warning. Or a team perhaps wants to go the\nextra mile and offer yet another differentiator for accessibility. Although\nconsistency is always the goal, there’s no need to avoid differentiation to\naccomodate user preferences. Whichever style you choose however, avoid mixing\nthroughout the UI.\n\nIf an alias that your product frequently uses has been removed from the set and\nyou can make a case for the importance of including it here, please let us know.\n\n### Status palette\n\nThe status palette includes all of the colors that can be used to reflect\nstatus. Typically, red represents danger or error, orange represents a serious\nwarning, yellow represents a regular warning, green represents normal or\nsuccess, and blue represents passive notifications, usually involving additional\ninformation and workflow progress. We’ve also included gray and purple to add\nmore depth to the system. Gray indicates drafts or jobs that haven’t been\nstarted, and purple indicates outliers or undefined statuses.\n\n<ColorPalette twoColumn type=\"status\" />\n\n#### Extended status palettes\n\nThis palette is only for added contrast accessibility when using yellows and\noranges. It’s not a part of the IBM brand palette and it’s also not included in\nthe v2 color release (that is, it’s not in ASE, Sketch kit palettes, and so on)\nbecause it’s for very selective use in data visualizations and certain status\nindicators. Do not use this palette in any other manner in your layouts.\n\n<ColorPalette type=\"status-extended\" shouldShowControls={false} />\n\n## Variants\n\nThere are at least four possible ways to implement status indicators:\n\n- Icon indicators\n- Badge indicators (with and without numbers)\n- Shape indicators\n- Differential indicators\n\n| Variant                           | Usage                                                                                                                                                                     | Context                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |\n| --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| Icon indicators                   | Used any time the layout offers ample space and the content requires maximum attention. They require an icon, a shape, a meaningful color and a descriptive inline label. | Icon indicators are widely used in [Notifications](/components/notification/usage), [Progress indicators](/components/progress-indicator/usage), [Data tables](/components/data-table/usage), task lists and dashboard widgets. |\n| Badge indicators (with number)    | Useful when a count of new or updated items is available, and it is important for the user to know the number of updates.                                                 | Most often used in notification panes in the header, and used in conjunction with avatars or icons.                                                                                                                             |\n| Badge indicators (without number) | Useful when new or updated items are available and the number of notifications is unknown or irrelevant to the user.

By default, Carbon uses sentence case for all button\nlabels.\n\nText labels, column labels (or a legend, when inline labels aren’t an option)\nare strongly recommended.\n\n<Row>\n<Column colLg={8}>\n\n![Anatomy images of the five types of status indicators](./images/status_indicator_3.png)\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\n<Row>\n<Column colSm={2} colMd={4} colLg={4}>\n\n#### 1.

Easily recognizable icons can make very effective communication tools and\ngreatly improve scannability, especially with large amounts of content. Icon\nindicators are widely used in notifications, progress indicators, data tables,\ntask lists and dashboard widgets.\n\n<Row>\n<Column colLg={8}>\n\n![Carbon notification component](./images/status_indicator_4.png)\n\n<Caption>\n  Notifications are the most prevalent example of this type of status indicator.\n</Caption>\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\n#### Type pairing and alignment\n\nIcon indicators are sometimes referred to as ‘contextual’ status indicators as\nwell because they are associated with a UI element or with a piece of content.\nAs such they should be shown in close proximity to that element.\n\nThere are also cases, especially in data tables and lists, where the column\nheading or row label may provide context that is additive to the inline label.\nWhen very common ‘stop light’ associations are present, as in the following\nexample, it may not be necessary to explicitly label an icon as ‘warning,’ or\n‘stable’ — as these interpretations are widely understood in product. However it\nis good practice to clarify the status intention in the text label.\n\n<DoDontRow>\n  <DoDont type=\"do\" caption=\"Do left align icons and type in lists and data tables, regardless of whether you’re using the responsive grid or spacers.\" colLg={6}>\n\n![Aligned status indicator icons.](images/status_indicator_5.png)\n\n  </DoDont>\n  <DoDont type=\"dont\" colLg={6} caption=\"Do not push icons out of alignment with label length. In this case, where the status indicators are flush right, the two digit labels are pushing the icons out of alignment.\">\n\n![Misaligned status indicator icons](images/status_indicator_6.png)\n\n  </DoDont>\n</DoDontRow>\n\n### Badge indicators\n\nBadge indicators let the user know that something is new or updated. A badge\nstatus is displayed over a ghost icon button, usually in the header, to indicate\nan active notification and is cleared after the user acknowledges the\nnotification. Depending on your use case, the icon button can open a new page or\nlaunch a modal, pane, or flyout.\n\n<Row>\n<Column colLg={8}>\n\n![Example of badge indicators in a global header](./images/status_indicator_7.png)\n\n<Caption>\n  Badge statuses with numbers are usually used for global notifications.\n</Caption>\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\n#### Badge status with number\n\nNumbers are used in conjunction with a badge status when a count of new or\nupdated items is available and it's important for the user to know the number of\nupdates.\n\nBadge status numbers can only be used in conjunction with the large icon button\nbecause with anything smaller, the icon gets covered. In very rare cases badge\nnumber may exceed two digits.\n\n<Row>\n<Column colLg={8}>\n\n![Four icons with badges that included numbers ranging from one to three digits. The last badge has a plus.](./images/badge-status-with-number.jpg)\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\n#### Badge status without number\n\nA badge indicator with no number is used when a new notification is available\nand the number of notifications is either unknown or irrelevant to the user. The\ndot badge is less noticeable than the numbered badge, but still draws the user’s\nattention to the icon button.\n\n### Shape indicators\n\nShape indicators combine color shape and text to create a standard and\nconsistent way to indicate the status of a device, feature, or version. Icons\nare not present. These shapes are also seen in certain diagrams and data\nvisualizations, for example network diagrams.\n\nThe shapes are only the most basic geometries, derived from the larger icon\ncontainers, so they can be easily discerned at small sizes. Shape indicators are\nnot available in outline because they are so small. The only situations in which\nyou would use an outline is to ensure contrast accessibility for yellows or\noranges in the Carbon light themes.\n\nThe table below is a first pass at establishing a standard lexicon for symbol\nindicators across IBM products.\n\n#### Same shape, different color\n\nThe status shapes naturally allow more room for interpretation than the status\nicons. Certain shapes can take on different colors for different circumstances.\nHowever, NEVER use the same shape, in different colors, within the same\nexperience.\n\n<StatusIndicatorTable attention=\"glyph\" />\n\n#### Type pairing and alignment\n\nShape indicators are also ‘contextual’ status indicators. Like the status icons\nabove, assets have been created for the shape indicators that take into account\noptical alignment. Do not attempt to create these shapes yourself. Use the\napproved shape indicator provided for you in the icon library.\n\nAs with the icons, choose the appropriate canvas size depending on the size of\nthe status label with which it is paired. 16px symbols are optimized to feel\nbalanced when paired with both 12px and 14px IBM Plex. Since shape indicators\nare most often reserved for small usage scenarios in product, we would advise\nyou to use full status indicators with 16px IBM Plex.\n\n<Row>\n<Column colLg={8}>\n\n![IBM Plex type and shape indicator pairing example](./images/status_indicator_8.png)\n\n<Caption>\n  Shape status canvases should be placed 4px from the beginning of the text box.\n</Caption>\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\n<Row>\n<Column colLg={8}>\n\n![Example of a contextual shape status indicator](./images/status_indicator_9.png)\n\n<Caption>Example of the status label directly next to the shape</Caption>\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\n#### Legends\n\nBecause shape indicators don’t have the added recognition of an icon, it’s even\nmore important that they are paired with a status label. Alternately, the\ndesigner can provide the user with a legend if a status label isn’t an option.\n\n<Row>\n<Column colLg={8}>\n\n![Example of a legend paired with a shape indicator](./images/status_indicator_10.png)\n\n<Caption>\n  Example where the status symbol indicator depends on the legend at the top of\n  the page\n</Caption>\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\n<Title>Best practices</Title>\n\n<DoDontRow>\n<DoDont\ntype=\"do\"\ncaption=\"Do place shape indicators before labels; they can be placed after other text only if there is no character count variation.\">\n\n![Do place shape indicators before labels; they can be placed after other text only if there is no character count variation.](./images/status_indicator_11.png)\n\n</DoDont>\n\n<DoDont\ntype=\"dont\"\ncaption=\"Do not place shape indicators after the labels to avoid pushing them out of alignment.\">\n\n![Do not place shape indicators after the labels to avoid pushing them out of alignment](./images/status_indicator_12.png)\n\n</DoDont>\n</DoDontRow>\n\n<DoDontRow>\n<DoDont\ntype=\"do\"\ncaption=\"Do use shape, color, and status labels to improve scannability.\">\n\n![Do use shape, color, and status labels to improve scannability.](./images/status_indicator_13.png)\n\n</DoDont>\n\n<DoDont\ntype=\"dont\"\ncaption=\"Avoid using only color and status labels to differentiate your content.\">\n\n![Avoid using only color and status labels to differentiate your content.](./images/status_indicator_14.png)\n\n</DoDont>\n</DoDontRow>\n\n### Differential indicators\n\nDifferential indicators often help users understand the movement or changes in\ninformation. They are especially useful when users are monitoring differences in\nlarge lists of statistics and anything other than type would be too obtrusive.\nExamples include the common convention of color-coding stock symbols in an\ninvestment account if their price has changed substantially. Designers also rely\non them to highlight deltas in data visualizations.\n\nAlthough typographic indicators can be used without an icon as long as a minus\nor a plus sign is used, they are most often paired with arrow or caret icons in\nour system.\n\n<Row>\n<Column colLg={8}>\n\n![Caret and arrow icons](./images/status_indicator_16.png)\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\n#### Color\n\nDifferential indicators are either displaying a positive or a negative value.\nColor is optional in these situations as long as the value has either a ‘+’ or\n‘-’ in front of it, a chevron icon, or an arrow icon. Unless the data involves\ntemperature, positive values are represented by the green spectrum and negative\nvalues are represented by the red spectrum.\n\n<Row>\n<Column colLg={8}>\n\n![Examples of differential indicators](./images/status_indicator_15.png)\n\n<Caption>Differential indicators are most often seen in dashboards.</Caption>\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\n## Accessibility\n\nAccessible design not only helps users with disabilities, it provides better\nuser experiences for everyone. The most common form of color blindness is\nred/green color blindness. The inability for some users to distinguish between\nred and green means that products cannot simply rely on color to show status. As\na result, the status system relies on three key elements; color, shape, and\nsymbol.\n\nFor example, the critical icon is not just “red”, it is the sum of the following\nelements.\n\nColor = Red <br /> Shape = Circle <br /> Symbol = \\ <br /> Text = Critical\n\n<br />\n\n<DoDontRow>\n  <DoDont type=\"do\" caption=\"Do include at least three out of four indicators of status to meet accessibility requirements.\" colLg={6}>\n\n![Example of accessible status indicators](images/status_indicator_17.png)\n\n  </DoDont>\n  <DoDont type=\"dont\" colLg={6} caption=\"Avoid designs with less than three indicators of status; using solely color and symbols is inaccessible.\">\n\n![Example of inaccessible status indicators](images/status_indicator_18.png)\n\n  </DoDont>\n</DoDontRow>\n\n### Status notifications\n\n#### Don’t use notifications that dismiss on a timer for critical or emergency messages.\n\nSome users with disabilities need more time to read or interact with messages\nand timed toasts may not provide sufficient time. WCAG 2.1 success criterion\n2.2.4 (AAA)\n\n#### Users should be able to manage or limit non-critical notifications.\n\nThis gives users the control to reduce the number of distractions or disruptions\nthey receive, which is particularly helpful for users with cognitive\nlimitations.
