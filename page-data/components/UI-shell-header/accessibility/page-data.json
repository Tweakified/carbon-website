Carbon also supports assistive technologies such\nas screen readers by setting labeling and page structure.\n\n### Keyboard interaction\n\nEach element in the header can be reached by the `Tab` key. A \"Skip to main\ncontent\" link appears when a keyboard user first tabs into the page. Links and\nicons are activated by `Enter`. Icons can also be activated by `Space`.\n\n<Row>\n<Column colLg={8}>\n\n![example of header keyboard interaction](images/header-accessibility-1.png)\n\n<Caption>\n  Pressing the Tab key reveals a 'Skip to main' link and then moves between\n  other header elements.\n</Caption>\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\n### Regions\n\n<Row>\n<Column colLg={8}>\n\n![example of header keyboard interaction](images/header-accessibility-2.png)\n\n<Caption>\n  Carbon applies a header region around the whole UI shell header.\n</Caption>\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\n### Labeling\n\nCarbon provides default names for each icon-only button in the header, and these\nnames are revealed on hover or focus. Interactions for some header components\nare covered under other component topics such as\n[search](/components/search/usage),\n[notifications](/components/notifications/usage), and the\n[UI shell right panel switcher](components/UI-shell-right-panel/usage/#switcher).\n\n<Row>\n<Column colLg={8}>\n\n![annotation showing search, help, notification and app switcher icons](images/header-accessibility-3.png)\n\n<Caption>\n  Carbon provides default names for its icon-only components and reveals them on\n  hover or focus.\n</Caption>\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\n## Design recommendations\n\nFor every product, there should be a one-time design exercise to annotate the UI\nshell keyboard interaction. This is an important step to carry out, since header\nfunctionality and component names vary significantly between products, even\nthough they appear similar until interacted with. Annotating expected behavior\nincreases consistent implementation.
