Any issue that the Carbon team accepts, but can not fit in their\nroadmap, is open for community contribution.\n\n#### Volunteer for existing work\n\nThe best way to volunteer is to look through\n[existing GitHub issues](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22needs%3A+community+contribution%22+)\nlabeled with `needs: community contribution`. Any issue labeled with\n`needs: code contribution` is fair game! Put a comment in the issue saying you'd\nlike to help.\n\n<Video\n  src=\"/videos/code-contribution.mp4\"\n  poster=\"/videos/code-contribution.png\"\n>\n  <track default srcLang=\"en\" title=\"Volunteer for existing work\" />\n</Video>\n\nIf you want to join an issue that is already assigned to someone or has a\nspecific milestone, please discuss with the assignee of the issue or with the\nCarbon team to coordinate.\n\nIssues labeled `good first issue` are great candidates to pick up if you are in\nthe code for the first time. The Carbon team is also happy to help you. Just\nstop by our [Carbon Developer office hours](/whats-happening/meetups/) or\n[contact us](/help/contact-us/) directly.\n\n#### Submit an idea or bug report\n\nHave a new idea that you think would benefit Carbon? Or do you need to report a\nbug? First, be sure to look through the\n[issue backlog](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon/issues) to make\nsure it is a novel idea or bug. Then, file your proposal on GitHub using the\n[issue templates](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon/issues/new/choose).\nIf you're willing to work on this idea yourself, be sure to let us know in your\nissue! Your idea will then go through a triage process by the Carbon team.\n\n## Step 2: Set up your environment\n\n[Follow these steps](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon/blob/main/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md)\nto install the tools, set up your environment, and learn how to make a pull\nrequest. You can explore all the repositories in the Carbon Design system\n[here](https://github.com/carbon-design-system), but you will likely be working\nin one of the following:\n\n- [Carbon website](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon-website/)\n- [Carbon monorepo](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon)\n- [Carbon Angular](https://github.com/IBM/carbon-components-angular/)\n- [Carbon Vue](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon-components-vue/)\n- [Carbon charts](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon-charts/)\n\nIf you need help troubleshooting, [reach out](/help/contact-us/) to the Carbon\nteam.\n\n## Step 3: Refine the issue\n\nYour dev environment is set up and you might be tempted to jump into coding.\nBefore you get started, we recommend you refine the issue by creating a rough\ntask list and posting it in the issue comments.\n\nIf you have trouble answering any of these questions, reach out to the Carbon\nteam and we will help you refine your issue:\n\n- Am I clear on the scope of this work?\n- Is this task list feasible for me to do?\n- Should a designer get involved to do initial research or create a design spec?\n- Do I need to collaborate with anyone else?\n\n## Step 4: Get feedback\n\nMost contributors work in groups of 2-3 and either set up weekly sessions or\njoin [meetups](/whats-happening/meetups/#carbon-office-hours) such as the Data\nViz Guild or Carbon Developer office hours. In these sessions, it is common to\nshare work in progress and ask lots of questions. As you make progress, update\nyour GitHub issue.\n\nWork that results in code will be reviewed directly in a pull request.\nMaintainers will be reviewing your work and making comments, asking questions\nand suggesting changes to be made before they merge your code. When you need to\nmake a change, commit and push to your branch normally. Once all revisions to\nyour pull request are complete, a maintainer will squash and merge your commits\nfor you.\n","type":"Mdx","contentDigest":"7297c004ed73d34242f5ae1f0d0b091c","owner":"gatsby-plugin-mdx","counter":4778},"frontmatter":{"title":"Code","description":"Code contributions can include anything from squashing bugs to adding feature requests.
