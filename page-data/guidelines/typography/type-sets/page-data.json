The productive and expressive type sets support designers creating\nfor a full range of user needs and activities across product and web pages. To\nunderstand when to use styles from each set, see\n[Style strategies](/guidelines/typography/style-strategies).\n\n#### Base type sizes\n\nThe productive type set uses a base type size of 14px, while the expressive type\nset uses a base type size of 16px.\n\n#### Style naming conventions\n\nWithin **Body styles** and **Supporting styles**, the same set of styles are\noffered, and an easy way to spot which type set they belong to is to look at the\nsuffix. Productive styles are named with a suffix of `-01` and expressive style\nnames have a suffix of `-02`.\n\n#### Two heading sets\n\nThere are two heading sets, one for productive and one for expressive. The major\ndifference between them is in how they are implemented in code because of the\nnature of the pages.\n\n- The productive type set uses _fixed_ headings. Product pages have a higher\n  density of information housed inside containers for space efficiency, and in\n  these situations fixed type styles are a must.\n\n- The expressive type set has two fixed headings that are to be used where\n  smaller headings are needed. The remaining headings are _fluid_. Web pages\n  need to be able to flex and work at different breakpoints, and the fluid\n  heading styles change size at different breakpoints, and can\n  extrapolate/stretch in between sizes for smooth transitions.\n\n## Utility styles\n\nThe utility styles are used with productive and expressive moments and include\nstyles for code snippets, labels for captions and helper text, as well as legal\ncopy. Productive styles have a suffix of `-01` and expressive styles have a\nsuffix of `-02`.\n\n<TypesetStyle typesets=\"smallStyle\" />\n\n## Body styles\n\nThere are two body styles for productive and expressive moments. Productive\nstyles have a suffix of `-01` and expressive styles have a suffix of `-02`.\n\n<TypesetStyle typesets=\"body\" />\n\n## Fixed heading styles\n\nThe fixed heading styles are used for product pages where multiple containers\nare used and space efficiency is key. Fixed means they are not responsive. The\ntype size remains constant regardless of break point.\n\nCreators of web pages also use the fixed headings `-01` and `-02` where smaller\nheadings are needed.\n\n<TypesetStyle typesets=\"fixedHeadings\" />\n\n## Fluid heading styles\n\nThe fluid heading styles are primarily used in web pages, and are therefore part\nof the expressive set of type styles. These headings are responsive and the type\nstyles change size at different breakpoints.\n\nDo not use these styles inside a container. They may be used in product pages\nwhere text sits outside of a container, and a blend of expressive and productive\ntype styles is desired for hierarchy and distinction. For more information, see\n[Style strategies](/guidelines/typography/style-strategies).\n\n<TypesetStyle typesets=\"fluidHeadings\" breakpointControls={true} />\n\n## Fluid display styles\n\nThe callout and display styles are part of the expressive set and being fluid,\nthey will adjust at different breakpoints. Do not use these styles inside a\ncontainer. For guidance about using display styles, see\n[Style strategies](/guidelines/typography/style-strategies#expressive-use-cases).\n\n<TypesetStyle typesets=\"fluidCallouts,fluidDisplay\" breakpointControls={true} />\n\n## Questions?\n\n_For IBMers only:_ If you have any questions about using either of these\nexperiences, reach out to the teams on Slack or sign up to share your work in a\nreview.\n\n#### Carbon Design System\n\n- Slack channel:\n  [#carbon-design-system](https://ibm-studios.slack.com/messages/C0M053VPT/)\n- [Meetups](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/whats-happening/meetups/) with\n  Carbon Design System\n\n#### Carbon for IBM Dotcom\n\n- Slack channel:\n  [#carbon-for-ibm-dotcom](https://cognitive-app.slack.com/archives/C2PLX8GQ6)\n- Office hours with Carbon for IBM.com.
