The user navigates to the Import button using the `Tab` key. If Import is\n   launched from an overflow menu, the user may navigate to Import within the\n   overflow menu using the `Up` and `Down` arrow keys.\n2. The focus state is applied to the button/menu item.\n3. The user presses `Enter` to launch the Import modal.\n\n#### Focus\n\n1. On opening the modal (page, or panel), the focus is applied to the first\n   field that accepts user input. In the case of Import modals, this is the drag\n   & drop area.\n2. On `Tab`, focus is applied to the second field that accepts user input. If\n   the URL field option is present, focus is applied to this.\n3. If enabled, on `Tab`, focus is applied to the primary button (for example\n   Save or Next). An Import button should not be enabled until a file is\n   selected.\n4. On `Tab`, focus is applied to the Cancel button.\n\nThe user cycles input methods using `Tab` and hits `Return` to activate their\nchosen option (file uploader or URL).\n\n_Using the file uploader_  \nIf the user chooses the file uploader, they select files using the\nbrowser-native file browser and click the call to action. This returns them to\nthe modal with an optional file loading state.\n\n_Using the URL field_  \nIf the user chooses the URL field, the field gains focus and the user inputs\ntheir URL.  \nOn `Tab`, focus is applied to the Add file button.  \nOn `Return` the file is uploaded with an optional loading state. The user can\nalso key `Return` while focus is applied to the URL field to trigger the Add\nfile button.\n\n#### Once the file is selected\n\n1. Focus is applied to the remove icon on the added file. The user hits `Return`\n   to remove the chosen file and return to the original state of the modal.\n2. On `Tab`, focus is applied to the Import button\n3. On `Tab`, focus is applied to the Cancel button\n\n### Multiple file uploads and imports\n\nWhen multiple files may be selected a modal is not used.\n\n#### Focus\n\n1. On entering an Import section or page, focus on the first `Tab` keystroke is\n   applied to the first field accepting user input. In most cases this is the\n   file uploader.\n2. On `Tab`, focus is applied to the the URL field.\n3. The user keys `Return` to choose between the file uploader and URL field.\n\n_Using the file uploader_  \nIf the user chooses the file uploader, they select files using the\nbrowser-native file selector and click the call to action. This returns them to\nthe page with an optional file loading state.\n\n_Using the URL field_  \nIf the user chooses the URL field, the field gains focus and the user inputs\ntheir URL.  \nOn `Tab`, focus is applied to the Add file button.  \nOn `Return` the file is uploaded with an optional loading state. The user can\nalso key `Return` while focus is applied to the URL field to trigger the Add\nfile button.\n\n#### When (some) files are selected\n\nWhen some of the allowed number of files are selected, focus cycles through\nadding more files and removing the selected files.\n\n- Focus returns to the just-used file selection method. For example, if the file\n  added so far was added by URL, return focus to the URL field to allow the user\n  to add another.\n- If the method used was the file uploader, on `Tab`, apply focus to the URL\n  field.\n- On `Tab`, apply focus to the remove icon on the added file(s), moving through\n  each using `Tab`.\n\n#### On reaching the maximum number of added files\n\nIn some use cases, there are a maximum number of allowed files. In this\nsituation, the file selection methods are in disabled state. Focus cycles\nbetween the selected files remove actions, and moving to the next section of the\npage.\n\n1. On returning to the page/panel from the final file uploader/add file\n   interaction, (after any optional loading state) focus is applied to the\n   remove icon on the uploaded files.\n2. On keying `Tab`, focus moves through the remove icon of each uploaded file.\n3. On continued use of `Tab`, focus is applied to the next section or\n   interaction in the page.\n\n## Feedback\n\nPlease help us improve by raising an issue on Carbon.\n","type":"Mdx","contentDigest":"010d91808ee22721c54af88b851d3d05","owner":"gatsby-plugin-mdx","counter":5052},"frontmatter":{"title":"Import","description":"The import action transfers data or objects from an external source into a system."},"exports":{},"rawBody":"---\ntitle: Import\ndescription:\n  The import action transfers data or objects from an external source into a\n  system.\n---\n\n#### Maintainers:\n\n[Vikki Paterson](https://github.com/vikkipaterson),\n[Chloe Poulter](https://github.com/chloepoulterdesign)\n\n<PageDescription>\n\nThe import action transfers data or objects from an external source into a\nsystem.\n\n</PageDescription>\n\n<InlineNotification>\n\nThis pattern uses Carbon's\n[File uploader](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/components/file-uploader/usage/)\n(drag & drop) component.\n\n</InlineNotification>\n\n<AnchorLinks>\n  <AnchorLink>Choose a file (modal)</AnchorLink>\n  <AnchorLink>Choose a file (full page or side-panel)</AnchorLink>\n  <AnchorLink>Accessibility</AnchorLink>\n</AnchorLinks>\n\n![Example of an import modal](/images/0.png)\n\n<Caption>Example of an import modal</Caption>\n\n## Choose a file (modal)\n\nWhere a single file is imported, import can take place in a modal.\n\nWhen importing, users should have the option of uploading a local file using the\nfile upload component, offering file drag and drop and the ability to browse\nlocally to select a file.
