This consistency is grounded\nin a set of well-defined rules about how to work with the Carbon component\nlibrary in the context of dark and light themes.\n\n<GifPlayer color=\"dark\">\n\n![6 screenshots showing a range of color schemes and considerations for text and data visualizations](images/introduction.gif)\n![UI color alternatives](images/introduction.jpeg)\n\n</GifPlayer>\n\n## Color anatomy\n\nCarbon’s default themes are derived from the IBM Design Language color palette.\nThe neutral gray family is dominant in the default themes, making use of subtle\nshifts in value to organize content into distinct zones.\n\nThe core blue family serves as the primary action color across all IBM products\nand experiences. Additional colors are used sparingly and purposefully.\n\n<div>\n  <ColorGrid colorFamily=\"blue\" />\n  <ColorGrid colorFamily=\"gray\" />\n</div>\n{/* possible TODO: remove inline style */}\n<ColorGrid colorFamily=\"alerts\" style={{ marginTop: '2rem' }} />\n<Caption>Alert Colors</Caption>\n\n### Layering model\n\nColors in the neutral gray palette are layered on top of each other to create\ndepth and spatial associations. The layering model defines the logic of how\ncolors stack on top of each other in a UI when using the Carbon themes. Aspects\nof the layering model are built directly into the themes, color tokens, and\ncomponents.\n\nThe layering model differs between the _light_ and _dark_ themes.\n\n- In the light themes, layers alternate between White and Gray 10 with each\n  added layer.\n- In the dark themes, layers become one step lighter with each added layer.\n\n<Row>\n<Column colLg={12}>\n\n![Layering model for light themes](images/color-layering-model.png)\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\n<Caption>\n  Layering model for the White theme (left) and Gray 100 theme (right)\n</Caption>\n\n<br />{' '}\n\n## Implementing color\n\nCarbon uses tokens and themes to manage color. Tokens are role-based, and themes\nspecify the color values that serve those roles in the UI.\n\n| Term    | Definition                                                                                                                                                                      |\n| ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| _Theme_ | A theme is a collection of colors designed to create a specific aesthetic. Themes control the color value assigned to a token. For example, Gray 100 theme.                     |\n| _Token_ | A token is the role-based identifier that assigns a color. Unlike hex codes, tokens apply universally across themes. For example, `$layer`, `$border-subtle`, `$support-error`. |\n| _Role_  | A role is the systematic usage of a color assigned to a token. Roles cannot be changed between themes.                                                                          |\n| _Value_ | A value is the unique visual attribute (hex code, rgba value) assigned to a token through the use of themes.                                                                    |\n\n## Themes\n\nThemes serve as an organizational framework for color in Carbon, with each theme\nbased on a specific primary background color. And they actually get their names\nfrom their background color. There are two default _light_ themes and two\ndefault _dark_ themes.\n\nThe light themes are based on White and Gray 10 backgrounds, and the dark themes\nuse Gray 100 and Gray 90 backgrounds. Within each theme, the values for the\nuniversal color tokens use the primary background color as the base of its\nlayering model.\n\n<Row className=\"color-blocks\">\n<Column colSm={1} colMd={1} colLg={2}>\n\n<div className=\"cds--aspect-ratio cds--aspect-ratio--1x1\">\n  <div className=\"cds--aspect-ratio--object color-square color-square--white\">\n    White\n  </div>\n</div>\n\n<div className=\"cds--caption\">Light</div>\n\n</Column>\n<Column colSm={1} colMd={1} colLg={2}>\n\n<div className=\"cds--aspect-ratio cds--aspect-ratio--1x1\">\n  <div className=\"cds--aspect-ratio--object color-square color-square--gray-10\">\n    Gray 10\n  </div>\n</div>\n\n</Column>\n<Column colSm={1} colMd={1} colLg={2}>\n\n<div className=\"cds--aspect-ratio cds--aspect-ratio--1x1\">\n  <div className=\"cds--aspect-ratio--object color-square color-square--gray-100\">\n    Gray 100\n  </div>\n</div>\n\n<div className=\"cds--caption\">Dark</div>\n\n</Column>\n<Column colSm={1} colMd={1} colLg={2}>\n\n<div className=\"cds--aspect-ratio cds--aspect-ratio--1x1\">\n  <div className=\"cds--aspect-ratio--object color-square color-square--gray-90\">\n    Gray 90\n  </div>\n</div>\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\n<br />\n<Title> Global background colors </Title>\n\n| Theme    | Primary background      | Token         | Hex value |                                             |\n| -------- | ----------------------- | ------------- | --------- | ------------------------------------------: |\n| White    | Global Background Light | `$background` | `#ffffff` |  <ColorBlock size=\"xs\">#ffffff</ColorBlock> |\n| Gray 10  | Global Background Light | `$background` | `#f4f4f4` | <ColorBlock  size=\"xs\">#f4f4f4</ColorBlock> |\n| Gray 90  | Global Background Dark  | `$background` | `#262626` | <ColorBlock  size=\"xs\">#282828</ColorBlock> |\n| Gray 100 | Global Background Dark  | `$background` | `#161616` | <ColorBlock  size=\"xs\">#171717</ColorBlock> |\n\n<br />\n\n### Light themes\n\nThere are two light themes in Carbon: White and Gray 10. For enabled UI colors\nlight themes primarily use the color range of White to Gray 20, and for text and\nicons uses the color range between Gray 100 and Gray 60.\n\nAll of the themes are available in [Design kits](/designing/kits/figma/).\n\n#### Layering model\n\nIn the light themes, layers alternate between White and Gray 10.\n\n- **White theme**: uses White as the global background color and is layered\n  first with components using Gray 10 backgrounds. The second layer uses White\n  and the third layer used Gray 10.\n- **Gray 10 theme:** uses Gray 10 as the global background color and is layered\n  first with components using White backgrounds.

For enabled UI colors, dark\nthemes primarily use the color range of Gray 100 through Gray 70, and for text\nand icons uses the color range between White and Gray 50.\n\nAll of the themes are available in [Design kits](/designing/kits/figma/).\n\n#### Layering model\n\nIn the dark themes, layers become one step lighter with each added layer.\n\n- **Gray 90 theme**: uses Gray 90 as the global background color and is layered\n  first with components using Gray 80 backgrounds. The second layer uses Gray 70\n  and the third layer used Gray 60.\n- **Gray 100 theme:** uses Gray 100 as the global background color and is\n  layered first with components using Gray 90 backgrounds.

This technique is useful to focus\nattention or create visual tension. Some high contrast moments are baked into\nthe themes by using the `inverse` tokens, like the tooltip component. Other\ntimes high contrast moments can be achieved through applying\n[inline theming](/guidelines/color/usage#inline-theming) for instances like a\ndark UI Shell Header with a light theme page.\n\n<DoDontRow>\n  <DoDont type=\"do\" colLg={6}>\n\n![High contrast example in a light theme.](images/High_contrast_01.png)\n\n  </DoDont>\n  <DoDont type=\"do\" colLg={6}>\n\n![High contrast example in a dark theme.](images/High_contrast_02.png)\n\n  </DoDont>\n</DoDontRow>\n\n<br />\n\n## Tokens\n\nTokens are a method of applying color in a consistent, reusable, and scalable\nway. They help us abstract how we use color from the values themselves. They are\nused in place of hard coded values, like hex codes. Tokens allow for value\nchanges to be made at scale, making design language changes easy to implement,\nas well as making possible color functionalities like inline theming and light\nor dark mode.\n\nEach token is assigned a role and a value. The role determines what element to\napply a token too and the value is the actual color (hex code) that appears in\nthe assigned theme. Color token names and roles are the same across themes, only\nthe assigned value will change with the theme. For example, under the hood\nthe `$text-secondary` token can dynamically map to `Gray 70` or `Gray 30`\ndepending on the theme.\n\nSee the [tokens](/guidelines/color/tokens) tab for the full list of color\ntokens.\n\n### Token names\n\nFor quick reference, the role of a token is represented in the token name itself\nto help you correctly apply tokens. The first part of the token name references\nthe general UI element the color is being applied to,\nlike `background`, `text`, or `border`. The second part of token name will\nspecify its unique role within the element group\nlike `$border-subtle` or `$text-primary`. Additionally, some tokens include an\ninteraction state at the end, like `$background-hover`.\n\n<Row>\n<Column colLg={12}>\n\n![Generic text input showing same tokens assigned for White and Gray 100 themes.](images/color-overview-tokens.png)\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\n<Caption>\n  Color tokens for components are the same across themes as shown by this text\n  input using the White theme (left) and Gray 100 theme (right).\n</Caption>\n\n<br />\n\n### Core tokens\n\nColor tokens that can be applied across components are called _core tokens_.\nThere are ten main groups of core color tokens. They are grouped by the common\nUI element that they are applied to. Token groups makes it easier to find and\napply color tokens. Interaction state tokens are included in the group along\nside their enabled state tokens. There are a few core tokens that do not belong\nto the a group and stand as individual tokens like `$overlay`, `$highlight`,\nand `$interactive`.\n\nSome core tokens are part of an additional token group called _layering tokens_.\nThese tokens are used to implement the layering model onto components. For more\ninformation, see the [usage tab](/guidelines/color/usage#layering-tokens).\n\n| Token group | Applied to                                                                          |\n| ----------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| Background  | Page or primary backgrounds                                                         |\n| Layer       | Stacked backgrounds (includes layering tokens)                                      |\n| Field       | Form and input backgrounds (includes layering tokens)                               |\n| Border      | Dividers, rules, and borders between and around elements (includes layering tokens) |\n| Text        | Type and type styles                                                                |\n| Link        | Standalone and inline links                                                         |\n| Icon        | Icons and pictograms                                                                |\n| Support     | Notification elements and status indicators                                         |\n| Focus       | Focus states                                                                        |\n| Skeleton    | Skeleton states                                                                     |\n\n<br />\n\n### Component tokens\n\nSome components have their own specific color tokens, known as _component\ntokens_. They represent the properties associated with a particular component.\nThey are not global tokens like the core tokens and should never be used for\nanything other than their own component. For a full list for component tokens\nsee the [tokens](/guidelines/color/tokens)tab.\n\nTo see how the tokens are applied in the components themselves, visit the\ncomponent’s style page.\n\n- [Button](/components/button/style#color)\n- [Tag](/components/tag/style#color)\n- [Notification](/components/notification/style#color)\n\n## Interaction states\n\nIn addition to the core set of enabled-state tokens, there are five other\ninteraction states defined with tokens for each theme. Interaction tokens are\nsignified by the addition of a state name added to the end of the base token\nname. For example, the `$background` hover state token is `$background-hover`.\n\nThe color layering model for interaction tokens is as follows:\n\n- For values between Black and Gray 70, interaction gets lighter.\n- For values between Gray 60 and White, interaction gets darker.\n\n<Row>\n<Column colLg={12}>\n\n![Hover states palette](images/color-overview-interactive.png)\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\n<br />\n\n### Hover\n\nHover is a subtle visual change that appears when a mouse cursor moves over an\ninteractive element. Hover states have their own tokens and are identified by\n`-hover` added to the end of the base token name, such as `$background-hover`.\n\nIn the IBM themes, hover states token values are “half steps” between two\nadjacent colors on the IBM core color palette steps. These values fall outside\nof the IBM core color palette steps and have their own spectrum. Hover colors\nshould not be used for anything other hover states.\n\n- For values between Black and 70, the hover state is a half step lighter.\n- For values between 60 and White, the hover state is a half step darker.\n\nElements like text or icons that use `secondary` colors for their enabled state,\nwill change to the `primary` color on hover, giving them a subtle emphasis. Most\nof the time, this shift in color (on the text or icon element) will be\naccompanied by a background hover color shift as well. For example, an overflow\nmenu uses `$text-secondary` and `$layer` in its enabled state. On hover, the\ntext switches to `$text-primary` and the background to `$layer-hover`.\n\n<Row>\n<Column colLg={8}>\n\n![Hover state colors are half steps](images/color-overview-interactive-hover.png)\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\n<Caption>\n  Shown in the white theme, '$layer' enabled color (1) has a value of 10 and\n  '$layer-hover' (2) has a value of 15.\n</Caption>\n\n<br />\n\n### Active\n\nThe active state can be used to indicate a `click`, `tap` or down press of a\nbutton. Active tokens are identified by `-active` added after the base token\nname, such as `$button-primary-active`. Active state values are two full steps\nlighter or darker on the IBM color scale. For example, the Blue 60 active state\nis Blue 80.\n\n- For values between 100 and 70, the active state is two full steps lighter.\n- For values between 60 and 10, the active state is two full steps darker.\n\nThe exceptions are that White value shares the same active state value as Gray\n10, and Black value shares the same active state value as Gray 100.\n\n<Row>\n<Column colLg={8}>\n\n![Active state colors are two steps over](images/color-overview-interactive-active.png)\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\n<Caption>\n  Shown in the White theme, `$button-primary` enabled color (1) has a value of\n  Blue 60 and `$button-primary-active` active color (2) has a value of Blue 80.\n</Caption>\n\n<br />\n\n### Selected\n\nSelected states indicate item(s) or option(s) that have been chosen in the UI by\nthe user through any input method. Selected tokens are identified by the\n`-selected` added after base token name, such as `$layer-selected-01`. The color\nlogic for selected state is either one full step lighter or darker on the IBM\ncolor scale. For example, the Gray100 selected state is Gray 90.\n\n- For values between 100 and 70, the selected state is one full step lighter.\n- For values between 60 and 10, the selected state one full step darker.\n\nThe exception is that White shares the same selected state value as Gray 10, and\nBlack shares the same selected state value as Gray 100.\n\nElements like text or icons that use `secondary` colors for their enabled state,\nwill change to the `primary` color when selected, giving them a subtle emphasis.\nMost of the time, this shift in color (to the text or icon element) will be\naccompanied by a selected background color shift as well.\n\n<Row>\n<Column colLg={8}>\n\n![Selected state colors are one step over](images/color-overview-interactive-selected.png)\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\n<Caption>\n  Shown in the white theme, `$layer` enabled color (1) has a value of Gray 10\n  and `$layer-selected` selected color (2) has a value of Gray 20.\n</Caption>\n\n<br />\n\n### Focus\n\nThe focus state draws attention to the active element on a page when using the\nkeyboard or voice to navigate. In Carbon, the focus of an element is most\ncommonly indicated by a 2px border around the element. In order to make it easy\nto identify and locate on a page, most focus states use only one color per theme\ncontrolled through the `$focus` color token.\n\n- In the light themes, the focus state usually appears as a Blue 60 border.\n- In the dark themes, the focus state usually appears as a White border.\n\nThe exception is high contrast moments where a `$focus-inverse` color is used\ninstead.\n\nFocus states are required on all interactive elements and must pass 3:1 color\ncontrast accessibility. Often times to achieve proper 3:1 contrast a\n`$focus-inset` border is used between the focus border and the element itself.\n\n<Row>\n<Column colLg={8}>\n\n![Focus state colors](images/color-overview-interactive-focus.png)\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\n<Caption>\n  White theme `$focus` color (1) and Gray 90 theme `$focus` color (2).\n</Caption>\n\n<br />\n\n### Disabled\n\nA disabled state is applied to a component when the user is not allowed to\ninteract with the component due to either permissions, dependencies, or\npre-requisites. Disabled states completely remove the interactive function of a\ncomponent and therefore don't receive hover or focus. Disabled state styling is\nnot subject to WC3 contrast compliance standards and is intentionally\nde-emphasized in a faded fashion.\n\nDisabled elements are always styled in the Gray family no matter its base color.\nA component's specific styling will depend on the elements within it and what\nlayers they are placed on. Some tokens have their own specific disabled tokens,\nsuch as `$layer-disabled`, while other elements are grouped together and share a\ndisabled token like `$text-disabled`.\n\n- For the light themes, disabled color values range from White to Gray 50\n- For the dark themes, disabled color values range from Gray 90 to Gray 40\n\n## Accessibility\n\nUsing various forms of contrast is the most important consideration when making\nuser-friendly color and interface choices. Awareness of standards and best\npractices is the key to accessible color selections.\n\n<Row className=\"resource-card-group\">\n<Column colMd={4} colLg={4} noGutterSm>\n    <ResourceCard\n      subTitle=\"IBM Design Language: Accessibility\"\n      aspectRatio=\"2:1\"\n      href=\"https://www.ibm.com/design/language/color#accessibility\"\n      >\n\n<MdxIcon name=\"bee\" />\n\n  </ResourceCard>\n</Column>\n<Column colMd={4} colLg={4} noGutterSm>\n    <ResourceCard\n      subTitle=\"IBM Accessibility: Color and Contrast\"\n      aspectRatio=\"2:1\"\n      href=\"https://www.ibm.com/able/toolkit/design/visual/color-and-contrast\"\n      >\n\n<MdxIcon name=\"bee\" />\n\n  </ResourceCard>\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\n### Contrast ratios\n\nContrast is the difference in brightness between any two elements. The\n[Web Content Acessibility Guidelines (WCAG)](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/) set\nspecific ratios that achieve the minimum required contrast for legibility.\nGenerally speaking, small text is any size below 24px and requires a 4.5:1\ncontrast ratio. Large text is anything above 24px and requires a 3:1 contrast\nratio. Graphical elements, such as data visualizations, also require a 3:1\ncontrast ratio.\n\nThe IBM palette is comprised of twelve color grades—Black, White and ten values\nfor each hue. The following table indicates the minimum number of steps required\nto achieve commonly used contrast ratios between any two colors.\n\n<Row>\n<Column colLg={8}>\n<ArtDirection>\n\n![color grades - Mobile image](images/colorgrades_table_mobile.png)\n\n![color grades graphic](images/colorgrades_table.png)\n\n</ArtDirection>\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\n| Color 1 | Color 2 (4.5:1 contrast)   | Color 2 (3:1 contrast)     |\n| ------- | -------------------------- | -------------------------- |\n| Black   | 50 through White (6 steps) | 60 through White (5 steps) |\n| 100     | 50 through White (5 steps) | 60 through White (4 steps) |\n| 90      | 50 through White (4 steps) | 60 through White (3 steps) |\n| 80      | 40 through White (4 steps) | 50 through White (3 steps) |\n| 70      | 30 through White (4 steps) | 40 through White (3 steps) |\n| 60      | 20 through White (4 steps) | 20 through White (4 steps) |\n| 50      | 90 through Black (4 steps) | 80 through Black (3 steps) |\n| 40      | 80 through Black (4 steps) | 70 through Black (3 steps) |\n| 30      | 70 through Black (4 steps) | 70 through Black (4 steps) |\n| 20      | 70 through Black (5 steps) | 60 through Black (4 steps) |\n| 10      | 60 through Black (5 steps) | 50 through Black (4 steps) |\n| White   | 60 through Black (6 steps) | 50 through Black (5 steps) |\n\n## Resources\n\n<Row className=\"resource-card-group\">\n<Column  colLg={4} colMd={4} noGutterSm>\n  <ResourceCard\n    subTitle=\"RGB color palettes (.ase and .clr)\"\n    href=\"https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon/raw/v10/packages/colors/artifacts/IBM_Colors.zip\"\n    >\n\n<MdxIcon name=\"ase\" />\n\n  </ResourceCard>\n</Column>\n<Column colLg={4} colMd={4}  noGutterSm>\n  <ResourceCard\n    subTitle=\"Elements package: Color\"\n    href=\"https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon/tree/v10/packages/colors\"\n    >\n\n<MdxIcon name=\"github\" />\n\n  </ResourceCard>\n</Column>\n</Row>\n","type":"Mdx","contentDigest":"c79770800791392f5055f800f3ce374a","owner":"gatsby-plugin-mdx","counter":4843},"frontmatter":{"title":"Color","description":"Maintaining consistent and engaging digital interfaces throughout IBM, whether applications or experiences, demands extended guidance around color usage.","tabs":["Overview","Usage","Tokens","Code"]},"exports":{},"rawBody":"---\ntitle: Color\ndescription:\n  Maintaining consistent and engaging digital interfaces throughout IBM, whether\n  applications or experiences, demands extended guidance around color usage.\ntabs: ['Overview', 'Usage', 'Tokens', 'Code']\n---\n\nimport ColorBlock from 'components/ColorBlock';\nimport ColorGrid from 'components/ColorGrid';\n\n<PageDescription>\n\nMaintaining consistent and engaging digital interfaces throughout IBM, whether\napplications or experiences, demands extended guidance around color usage.

This consistency is grounded\nin a set of well-defined rules about how to work with the Carbon component\nlibrary in the context of dark and light themes.\n\n<GifPlayer color=\"dark\">\n\n![6 screenshots showing a range of color schemes and considerations for text and data visualizations](images/introduction.gif)\n![UI color alternatives](images/introduction.jpeg)\n\n</GifPlayer>\n\n## Color anatomy\n\nCarbon’s default themes are derived from the IBM Design Language color palette.\nThe neutral gray family is dominant in the default themes, making use of subtle\nshifts in value to organize content into distinct zones.\n\nThe core blue family serves as the primary action color across all IBM products\nand experiences. Additional colors are used sparingly and purposefully.\n\n<div>\n  <ColorGrid colorFamily=\"blue\" />\n  <ColorGrid colorFamily=\"gray\" />\n</div>\n{/* possible TODO: remove inline style */}\n<ColorGrid colorFamily=\"alerts\" style={{ marginTop: '2rem' }} />\n<Caption>Alert Colors</Caption>\n\n### Layering model\n\nColors in the neutral gray palette are layered on top of each other to create\ndepth and spatial associations. The layering model defines the logic of how\ncolors stack on top of each other in a UI when using the Carbon themes. Aspects\nof the layering model are built directly into the themes, color tokens, and\ncomponents.\n\nThe layering model differs between the _light_ and _dark_ themes.\n\n- In the light themes, layers alternate between White and Gray 10 with each\n  added layer.\n- In the dark themes, layers become one step lighter with each added layer.\n\n<Row>\n<Column colLg={12}>\n\n![Layering model for light themes](images/color-layering-model.png)\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\n<Caption>\n  Layering model for the White theme (left) and Gray 100 theme (right)\n</Caption>\n\n<br />{' '}\n\n## Implementing color\n\nCarbon uses tokens and themes to manage color. Tokens are role-based, and themes\nspecify the color values that serve those roles in the UI.\n\n| Term    | Definition                                                                                                                                                                      |\n| ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| _Theme_ | A theme is a collection of colors designed to create a specific aesthetic. Themes control the color value assigned to a token. For example, Gray 100 theme.                     |\n| _Token_ | A token is the role-based identifier that assigns a color. Unlike hex codes, tokens apply universally across themes. For example, `$layer`, `$border-subtle`, `$support-error`. |\n| _Role_  | A role is the systematic usage of a color assigned to a token. Roles cannot be changed between themes.                                                                          |\n| _Value_ | A value is the unique visual attribute (hex code, rgba value) assigned to a token through the use of themes.                                                                    |\n\n## Themes\n\nThemes serve as an organizational framework for color in Carbon, with each theme\nbased on a specific primary background color. And they actually get their names\nfrom their background color. There are two default _light_ themes and two\ndefault _dark_ themes.\n\nThe light themes are based on White and Gray 10 backgrounds, and the dark themes\nuse Gray 100 and Gray 90 backgrounds. Within each theme, the values for the\nuniversal color tokens use the primary background color as the base of its\nlayering model.\n\n<Row className=\"color-blocks\">\n<Column colSm={1} colMd={1} colLg={2}>\n\n<div className=\"cds--aspect-ratio cds--aspect-ratio--1x1\">\n  <div className=\"cds--aspect-ratio--object color-square color-square--white\">\n    White\n  </div>\n</div>\n\n<div className=\"cds--caption\">Light</div>\n\n</Column>\n<Column colSm={1} colMd={1} colLg={2}>\n\n<div className=\"cds--aspect-ratio cds--aspect-ratio--1x1\">\n  <div className=\"cds--aspect-ratio--object color-square color-square--gray-10\">\n    Gray 10\n  </div>\n</div>\n\n</Column>\n<Column colSm={1} colMd={1} colLg={2}>\n\n<div className=\"cds--aspect-ratio cds--aspect-ratio--1x1\">\n  <div className=\"cds--aspect-ratio--object color-square color-square--gray-100\">\n    Gray 100\n  </div>\n</div>\n\n<div className=\"cds--caption\">Dark</div>\n\n</Column>\n<Column colSm={1} colMd={1} colLg={2}>\n\n<div className=\"cds--aspect-ratio cds--aspect-ratio--1x1\">\n  <div className=\"cds--aspect-ratio--object color-square color-square--gray-90\">\n    Gray 90\n  </div>\n</div>\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\n<br />\n<Title> Global background colors </Title>\n\n| Theme    | Primary background      | Token         | Hex value |                                             |\n| -------- | ----------------------- | ------------- | --------- | ------------------------------------------: |\n| White    | Global Background Light | `$background` | `#ffffff` |  <ColorBlock size=\"xs\">#ffffff</ColorBlock> |\n| Gray 10  | Global Background Light | `$background` | `#f4f4f4` | <ColorBlock  size=\"xs\">#f4f4f4</ColorBlock> |\n| Gray 90  | Global Background Dark  | `$background` | `#262626` | <ColorBlock  size=\"xs\">#282828</ColorBlock> |\n| Gray 100 | Global Background Dark  | `$background` | `#161616` | <ColorBlock  size=\"xs\">#171717</ColorBlock> |\n\n<br />\n\n### Light themes\n\nThere are two light themes in Carbon: White and Gray 10. For enabled UI colors\nlight themes primarily use the color range of White to Gray 20, and for text and\nicons uses the color range between Gray 100 and Gray 60.\n\nAll of the themes are available in [Design kits](/designing/kits/figma/).\n\n#### Layering model\n\nIn the light themes, layers alternate between White and Gray 10.\n\n- **White theme**: uses White as the global background color and is layered\n  first with components using Gray 10 backgrounds. The second layer uses White\n  and the third layer used Gray 10.\n- **Gray 10 theme:** uses Gray 10 as the global background color and is layered\n  first with components using White backgrounds.

For enabled UI colors, dark\nthemes primarily use the color range of Gray 100 through Gray 70, and for text\nand icons uses the color range between White and Gray 50.\n\nAll of the themes are available in [Design kits](/designing/kits/figma/).\n\n#### Layering model\n\nIn the dark themes, layers become one step lighter with each added layer.\n\n- **Gray 90 theme**: uses Gray 90 as the global background color and is layered\n  first with components using Gray 80 backgrounds. The second layer uses Gray 70\n  and the third layer used Gray 60.\n- **Gray 100 theme:** uses Gray 100 as the global background color and is\n  layered first with components using Gray 90 backgrounds.

This technique is useful to focus\nattention or create visual tension. Some high contrast moments are baked into\nthe themes by using the `inverse` tokens, like the tooltip component. Other\ntimes high contrast moments can be achieved through applying\n[inline theming](/guidelines/color/usage#inline-theming) for instances like a\ndark UI Shell Header with a light theme page.\n\n<DoDontRow>\n  <DoDont type=\"do\" colLg={6}>\n\n![High contrast example in a light theme.](images/High_contrast_01.png)\n\n  </DoDont>\n  <DoDont type=\"do\" colLg={6}>\n\n![High contrast example in a dark theme.](images/High_contrast_02.png)\n\n  </DoDont>\n</DoDontRow>\n\n<br />\n\n## Tokens\n\nTokens are a method of applying color in a consistent, reusable, and scalable\nway. They help us abstract how we use color from the values themselves. They are\nused in place of hard coded values, like hex codes. Tokens allow for value\nchanges to be made at scale, making design language changes easy to implement,\nas well as making possible color functionalities like inline theming and light\nor dark mode.\n\nEach token is assigned a role and a value. The role determines what element to\napply a token too and the value is the actual color (hex code) that appears in\nthe assigned theme. Color token names and roles are the same across themes, only\nthe assigned value will change with the theme. For example, under the hood\nthe `$text-secondary` token can dynamically map to `Gray 70` or `Gray 30`\ndepending on the theme.\n\nSee the [tokens](/guidelines/color/tokens) tab for the full list of color\ntokens.\n\n### Token names\n\nFor quick reference, the role of a token is represented in the token name itself\nto help you correctly apply tokens. The first part of the token name references\nthe general UI element the color is being applied to,\nlike `background`, `text`, or `border`. The second part of token name will\nspecify its unique role within the element group\nlike `$border-subtle` or `$text-primary`. Additionally, some tokens include an\ninteraction state at the end, like `$background-hover`.\n\n<Row>\n<Column colLg={12}>\n\n![Generic text input showing same tokens assigned for White and Gray 100 themes.](images/color-overview-tokens.png)\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\n<Caption>\n  Color tokens for components are the same across themes as shown by this text\n  input using the White theme (left) and Gray 100 theme (right).\n</Caption>\n\n<br />\n\n### Core tokens\n\nColor tokens that can be applied across components are called _core tokens_.\nThere are ten main groups of core color tokens. They are grouped by the common\nUI element that they are applied to. Token groups makes it easier to find and\napply color tokens. Interaction state tokens are included in the group along\nside their enabled state tokens. There are a few core tokens that do not belong\nto the a group and stand as individual tokens like `$overlay`, `$highlight`,\nand `$interactive`.\n\nSome core tokens are part of an additional token group called _layering tokens_.\nThese tokens are used to implement the layering model onto components. For more\ninformation, see the [usage tab](/guidelines/color/usage#layering-tokens).\n\n| Token group | Applied to                                                                          |\n| ----------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| Background  | Page or primary backgrounds                                                         |\n| Layer       | Stacked backgrounds (includes layering tokens)                                      |\n| Field       | Form and input backgrounds (includes layering tokens)                               |\n| Border      | Dividers, rules, and borders between and around elements (includes layering tokens) |\n| Text        | Type and type styles                                                                |\n| Link        | Standalone and inline links                                                         |\n| Icon        | Icons and pictograms                                                                |\n| Support     | Notification elements and status indicators                                         |\n| Focus       | Focus states                                                                        |\n| Skeleton    | Skeleton states                                                                     |\n\n<br />\n\n### Component tokens\n\nSome components have their own specific color tokens, known as _component\ntokens_. They represent the properties associated with a particular component.\nThey are not global tokens like the core tokens and should never be used for\nanything other than their own component. For a full list for component tokens\nsee the [tokens](/guidelines/color/tokens)tab.\n\nTo see how the tokens are applied in the components themselves, visit the\ncomponent’s style page.\n\n- [Button](/components/button/style#color)\n- [Tag](/components/tag/style#color)\n- [Notification](/components/notification/style#color)\n\n## Interaction states\n\nIn addition to the core set of enabled-state tokens, there are five other\ninteraction states defined with tokens for each theme. Interaction tokens are\nsignified by the addition of a state name added to the end of the base token\nname. For example, the `$background` hover state token is `$background-hover`.\n\nThe color layering model for interaction tokens is as follows:\n\n- For values between Black and Gray 70, interaction gets lighter.\n- For values between Gray 60 and White, interaction gets darker.\n\n<Row>\n<Column colLg={12}>\n\n![Hover states palette](images/color-overview-interactive.png)\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\n<br />\n\n### Hover\n\nHover is a subtle visual change that appears when a mouse cursor moves over an\ninteractive element. Hover states have their own tokens and are identified by\n`-hover` added to the end of the base token name, such as `$background-hover`.\n\nIn the IBM themes, hover states token values are “half steps” between two\nadjacent colors on the IBM core color palette steps. These values fall outside\nof the IBM core color palette steps and have their own spectrum. Hover colors\nshould not be used for anything other hover states.\n\n- For values between Black and 70, the hover state is a half step lighter.\n- For values between 60 and White, the hover state is a half step darker.\n\nElements like text or icons that use `secondary` colors for their enabled state,\nwill change to the `primary` color on hover, giving them a subtle emphasis. Most\nof the time, this shift in color (on the text or icon element) will be\naccompanied by a background hover color shift as well. For example, an overflow\nmenu uses `$text-secondary` and `$layer` in its enabled state. On hover, the\ntext switches to `$text-primary` and the background to `$layer-hover`.\n\n<Row>\n<Column colLg={8}>\n\n![Hover state colors are half steps](images/color-overview-interactive-hover.png)\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\n<Caption>\n  Shown in the white theme, '$layer' enabled color (1) has a value of 10 and\n  '$layer-hover' (2) has a value of 15.\n</Caption>\n\n<br />\n\n### Active\n\nThe active state can be used to indicate a `click`, `tap` or down press of a\nbutton. Active tokens are identified by `-active` added after the base token\nname, such as `$button-primary-active`. Active state values are two full steps\nlighter or darker on the IBM color scale. For example, the Blue 60 active state\nis Blue 80.\n\n- For values between 100 and 70, the active state is two full steps lighter.\n- For values between 60 and 10, the active state is two full steps darker.\n\nThe exceptions are that White value shares the same active state value as Gray\n10, and Black value shares the same active state value as Gray 100.\n\n<Row>\n<Column colLg={8}>\n\n![Active state colors are two steps over](images/color-overview-interactive-active.png)\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\n<Caption>\n  Shown in the White theme, `$button-primary` enabled color (1) has a value of\n  Blue 60 and `$button-primary-active` active color (2) has a value of Blue 80.\n</Caption>\n\n<br />\n\n### Selected\n\nSelected states indicate item(s) or option(s) that have been chosen in the UI by\nthe user through any input method. Selected tokens are identified by the\n`-selected` added after base token name, such as `$layer-selected-01`. The color\nlogic for selected state is either one full step lighter or darker on the IBM\ncolor scale. For example, the Gray100 selected state is Gray 90.\n\n- For values between 100 and 70, the selected state is one full step lighter.\n- For values between 60 and 10, the selected state one full step darker.\n\nThe exception is that White shares the same selected state value as Gray 10, and\nBlack shares the same selected state value as Gray 100.\n\nElements like text or icons that use `secondary` colors for their enabled state,\nwill change to the `primary` color when selected, giving them a subtle emphasis.\nMost of the time, this shift in color (to the text or icon element) will be\naccompanied by a selected background color shift as well.\n\n<Row>\n<Column colLg={8}>\n\n![Selected state colors are one step over](images/color-overview-interactive-selected.png)\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\n<Caption>\n  Shown in the white theme, `$layer` enabled color (1) has a value of Gray 10\n  and `$layer-selected` selected color (2) has a value of Gray 20.\n</Caption>\n\n<br />\n\n### Focus\n\nThe focus state draws attention to the active element on a page when using the\nkeyboard or voice to navigate. In Carbon, the focus of an element is most\ncommonly indicated by a 2px border around the element. In order to make it easy\nto identify and locate on a page, most focus states use only one color per theme\ncontrolled through the `$focus` color token.\n\n- In the light themes, the focus state usually appears as a Blue 60 border.\n- In the dark themes, the focus state usually appears as a White border.\n\nThe exception is high contrast moments where a `$focus-inverse` color is used\ninstead.\n\nFocus states are required on all interactive elements and must pass 3:1 color\ncontrast accessibility. Often times to achieve proper 3:1 contrast a\n`$focus-inset` border is used between the focus border and the element itself.\n\n<Row>\n<Column colLg={8}>\n\n![Focus state colors](images/color-overview-interactive-focus.png)\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\n<Caption>\n  White theme `$focus` color (1) and Gray 90 theme `$focus` color (2).\n</Caption>\n\n<br />\n\n### Disabled\n\nA disabled state is applied to a component when the user is not allowed to\ninteract with the component due to either permissions, dependencies, or\npre-requisites. Disabled states completely remove the interactive function of a\ncomponent and therefore don't receive hover or focus. Disabled state styling is\nnot subject to WC3 contrast compliance standards and is intentionally\nde-emphasized in a faded fashion.\n\nDisabled elements are always styled in the Gray family no matter its base color.\nA component's specific styling will depend on the elements within it and what\nlayers they are placed on. Some tokens have their own specific disabled tokens,\nsuch as `$layer-disabled`, while other elements are grouped together and share a\ndisabled token like `$text-disabled`.\n\n- For the light themes, disabled color values range from White to Gray 50\n- For the dark themes, disabled color values range from Gray 90 to Gray 40\n\n## Accessibility\n\nUsing various forms of contrast is the most important consideration when making\nuser-friendly color and interface choices. Awareness of standards and best\npractices is the key to accessible color selections.\n\n<Row className=\"resource-card-group\">\n<Column colMd={4} colLg={4} noGutterSm>\n    <ResourceCard\n      subTitle=\"IBM Design Language: Accessibility\"\n      aspectRatio=\"2:1\"\n      href=\"https://www.ibm.com/design/language/color#accessibility\"\n      >\n\n<MdxIcon name=\"bee\" />\n\n  </ResourceCard>\n</Column>\n<Column colMd={4} colLg={4} noGutterSm>\n    <ResourceCard\n      subTitle=\"IBM Accessibility: Color and Contrast\"\n      aspectRatio=\"2:1\"\n      href=\"https://www.ibm.com/able/toolkit/design/visual/color-and-contrast\"\n      >\n\n<MdxIcon name=\"bee\" />\n\n  </ResourceCard>\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\n### Contrast ratios\n\nContrast is the difference in brightness between any two elements. The\n[Web Content Acessibility Guidelines (WCAG)](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/) set\nspecific ratios that achieve the minimum required contrast for legibility.\nGenerally speaking, small text is any size below 24px and requires a 4.5:1\ncontrast ratio. Large text is anything above 24px and requires a 3:1 contrast\nratio. Graphical elements, such as data visualizations, also require a 3:1\ncontrast ratio.\n\nThe IBM palette is comprised of twelve color grades—Black, White and ten values\nfor each hue. The following table indicates the minimum number of steps required\nto achieve commonly used contrast ratios between any two colors.\n\n<Row>\n<Column colLg={8}>\n<ArtDirection>\n\n![color grades - Mobile image](images/colorgrades_table_mobile.png)\n\n![color grades graphic](images/colorgrades_table.png)\n\n</ArtDirection>\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\n| Color 1 | Color 2 (4.5:1 contrast)   | Color 2 (3:1 contrast)     |\n| ------- | -------------------------- | -------------------------- |\n| Black   | 50 through White (6 steps) | 60 through White (5 steps) |\n| 100     | 50 through White (5 steps) | 60 through White (4 steps) |\n| 90      | 50 through White (4 steps) | 60 through White (3 steps) |\n| 80      | 40 through White (4 steps) | 50 through White (3 steps) |\n| 70      | 30 through White (4 steps) | 40 through White (3 steps) |\n| 60      | 20 through White (4 steps) | 20 through White (4 steps) |\n| 50      | 90 through Black (4 steps) | 80 through Black (3 steps) |\n| 40      | 80 through Black (4 steps) | 70 through Black (3 steps) |\n| 30      | 70 through Black (4 steps) | 70 through Black (4 steps) |\n| 20      | 70 through Black (5 steps) | 60 through Black (4 steps) |\n| 10      | 60 through Black (5 steps) | 50 through Black (4 steps) |\n| White   | 60 through Black (6 steps) | 50 through Black (5 steps) |\n\n## Resources\n\n<Row className=\"resource-card-group\">\n<Column  colLg={4} colMd={4} noGutterSm>\n  <ResourceCard\n    subTitle=\"RGB color palettes (.ase and .clr)\"\n    href=\"https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon/raw/v10/packages/colors/artifacts/IBM_Colors.zip\"\n    >\n\n<MdxIcon name=\"ase\" />\n\n  </ResourceCard>\n</Column>\n<Column colLg={4} colMd={4}  noGutterSm>\n  <ResourceCard\n    subTitle=\"Elements package: Color\"\n    href=\"https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon/tree/v10/packages/colors\"\n    >\n\n<MdxIcon name=\"github\" />\n\n  </ResourceCard>\n</Column>\n</Row>\n","fileAbsolutePath":"/home/runner/work/carbon-website/carbon-website/src/pages/guidelines/color/overview.mdx"}}},"staticQueryHashes":["1364590287","137577622","2102389209","2456312558","2746626797","3018647132","3037994772","768070550"]}
