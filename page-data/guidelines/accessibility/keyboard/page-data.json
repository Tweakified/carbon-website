Try to give all your users the same\nexperience.\n\nUse natively-accessible elements in navigation to activate links, buttons, and\nform controls with a keyboard. Reinforce\n[semantic HTML](./developers#use-semantic-html) to convey intent and meaning\ninstead of solely defining the look and feel of an element.
