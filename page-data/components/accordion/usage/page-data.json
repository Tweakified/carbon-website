The header title give the user a high level\noverview of the content allowing the user to decide which sections to read.\n\nAccordions can make information processing and discovering more effective.\nHowever, it does hide content from users and it's important to account for a\nuser not noticing or reading all of the included content. If a user is likely to\nread all of the content then don't use an accordion as it adds the burden of an\nextra click; instead use a full scrolling page with normal headers.\n\n### When to use\n\n- To organize related information.\n- To shorten pages and reduce scrolling when content is not crucial to read in\n  full.\n- When space is at a premium and long content cannot be displayed all at once,\n  like on a mobile interface or in a side panel.\n\n## Live demo\n\n<StorybookDemo\n  themeSelector\n  url=\"https://react.carbondesignsystem.com\"\n  variants={[\n    {\n      label: 'Default',\n      variant: 'components-accordion--default',\n    },\n  ]}\n/>\n\n## Formatting\n\n### Anatomy\n\n<Row>\n<Column colLg={8}>\n\n![accordion anatomy](images/accordion-anatomy.png)\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\n1. **Header**: contains the section title and is control for revealing the\n   panel.\n2. **Icon**: indicates if the panel is open or closed.\n3. **Panel**: the section of content associated with an accordion header.\n\n### Alignment\n\nBy default the chevron icon is placed on the `end` side of the header. This\nallows for the title on the `start` side to align with other type elements in\nthe layout, which is the preferred alignment scenario.\n\nHowever, in some rare scenarios, the accordion may be modified to place the icon\nin `start` front of the title to function more like a tree. Most instances\nshould use the default `end` alignment, especially for any pure content or\ndocumentation purposes. Icon placement in accordions should be consistent\nthroughout your page and should not alternate.\n\n<DoDontRow>\n<DoDont\ntype=\"do\"\ncolMd={4} colLg={4}\ncaption=\"In most cases, use the default end icon alignment to keep accordion text aligned with other content on the page.\">\n\n![Do use the default end icon alignment to keep accordion text aligned with other content on the page.](./images/accordion-alignment-do.png)\n\n</DoDont>\n<DoDont\ntype=\"do\"\ncolMd={4} colLg={4}\ncaption=\"In rare cases, you can place icons on the start side for tree like functionality.\">\n\n![Do place icons on the start side for tree like functionality.](./images/accordion-alignment-do-2.png)\n\n</DoDont>\n</DoDontRow>\n\n### Placement\n\nAccordions can be placed with main page content or placed inside of a container\nsuch as a side panel or tile.\n\n<Row>\n<Column  colLg={12} colMd={12} colSm={4}>\n<ArtDirection>\n\n![accordion placement](images/accordion-placement-2m.png)\n\n![accordion placement](images/accordion-placement-2.png)\n\n![accordion placement](images/accordion-placement-2.png)\n\n</ArtDirection>\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\n#### Grid placement\n\nWhen placing an accordion on the 2x Grid with its default alignment, the\nindented title and content align to the grid columns, and the top and bottom\nborders hang into the gutter. However, the accordion can be modified to have a\n[flush alignment](https://carbondesignsystem.com/components/accordion/usage#modifiers)\nwhere the titles and content are instead flush aligned with the top and bottom\nborders having 0px padding.\n\n<Row>\n<Column colLg={8}>\n\n![accordion grid placement](images/accordion-placement-1.png)\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\n## Content\n\n### Main elements\n\n#### Title\n\n- The title should be as brief as possible while still being clear and\n  descriptive.\n- Each title should be wrapped in a\n  [role heading](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices-1.1/#wai-aria-roles-states-and-properties)\n  (h1-h6) that is appropriate for the information architecture of the page.\n\n#### Body copy\n\n- Content inside of a section may be split into paragraphs and include\n  sub-headers if needed.\n\n### Scrolling content\n\nWhen the accordion content is longer than the viewport the whole accordion\nshould vertically scroll. Content should not scroll inside of an individual\npanel. Content should never scroll horizontally in an accordion.\n\n## Behaviors\n\n### States\n\nThe accordion component has two main states: **collapsed** and **expanded**. The\nchevron icon at the end of the accordion indicates which state the accordion is\nin. The chevron points down to indicate collapsed and up to indicate expanded.\n\nAccordions begin by default in the collapsed state with all content panels\nclosed. Starting in a collapsed state gives the user a high level overview of\nthe available information.\n\n<Row>\n<Column colLg={8}>\n\n![accordion states](images/accordion-state-1.png)\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\nA user can then independently expand each section of the accordion allowing for\nmultiple sections to be open at once.\n\n<Row>\n<Column colLg={8}>\n\n![multiple sections expanded](images/accordion-state-2.png)\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\nIn addition to the collapsed and expanded states, accordions also have\ninteractive states for focus, hover, and disabled. See the\n[style tab](/components/accordion/style) for more details.\n\n<Row>\n<Column colLg={8}>\n\n![accordion interactives states](images/accordion-state-3.png)\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\n### Interactions\n\n#### Mouse\n\nUsers can trigger a state change by clicking on the chevron or clicking anywhere\nin the header area.\n\n<Row>\n<Column colLg={8}>\n\n![accordion click targets](images/accordion-click-target.png)\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\n#### Keyboard\n\nUsers can navigate between accordion headers by pressing `Tab` or `Shift-Tab`.\nUsers can trigger a state change by pressing `Enter` or `Space` while the header\narea has focus. For additional keyboard interactions, see the\n[accessibility tab](/components/accordion/accessibility#keyboard-interactions).\n\n## Modifiers\n\n#### Flush alignment\n\nUse flush alignment when designing within smaller spaces on a page such as side\npanels or sidebars to achieve better text alignment with other content. Flush\nalignment is also used to help avoid converging rule lines between components\nthat are close to each other on a page.\n\n<Row>\n<Column colLg={8}>\n\n![accordion flush alignment](images/accordion-flush.png)\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\nFlush alignment places the row title and chevron icons with 0px padding, keeping\nthem flush to the rule dividers. For hover and focus interactive states, the\nleft and right padding receives an additional 16px padding.\n\n<Row>\n<Column colLg={8}>\n\n![accordion flush alignment spec](images/accordion-flush-spec.png)\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\n## Related\n\nThe following components are additional ways to organize content. Consider the\ntype and length of content you are working with when choosing a content\ncontainer.
