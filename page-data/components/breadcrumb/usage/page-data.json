They take up little\nspace but still provide context for the user's place in the navigation\nhierarchy.\n\n### When not to use\n\nBreadcrumbs are always treated as secondary and should never entirely replace\nthe primary navigation. They shouldn't be used for products that have single\nlevel navigation because they create unnecessary clutter.\n\nIf you are taking users through a multistep process use a\n[progress indicator](/components/progress-indicator/usage/) instead.\n\n### Types\n\nCarbon supports two types of breadcrumbs. Both types are styled the same, but\nthe methods for populating the breadcrumb trail are different. The breadcrumb\ntype used should be consistent across a product.\n\n| Breadcrumb type  | Purpose                                                                                                                                                                                    |\n| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |\n| _Location-based_ | These illustrate the site’s hierarchy and show the user where they are within that hierarchy.                                                                                              |\n| _Path-based_     | These show the actual steps the user took to get to the current page, rather than reflecting the site’s information architecture.
