The type of text field\nused should reflect the length of the content you expect the user to enter. The\ndefault text input is for short, one-line content, whereas text area is for\nlonger, multi-line entries.\n\n<Row>\n<Column colLg={8}>\n\n![Text input and text area example](images/text-input-usage-2.png)\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\n#### When to use\n\n- A user needs to input unique information that cannot be predicted with a\n  preset of options.\n- A user needs to input memorable data that can be entered more quickly in a\n  free-hand format versus a more complex control.\n\n#### When not to use\n\n- If a user can only enter an option from a predefined list then avoid using a\n  free-form text input as it is likely to result in an error. Consider using a\n  selection control such as a dropdown, select, or radio button group instead.\n\n### Variants\n\n| Variant                                                | Purpose                                                                               |\n| ------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| [Text input](/components/text-input/usage/#text-input) | When the expected user input is a single line of text.                                |\n| [Text area](/components/text-input/usage/#text-area)   | When the expected user input is more than a few words that could span multiple lines. |\n\n## Live demo\n\n<StorybookDemo\n  themeSelector\n  url=\"https://react.carbondesignsystem.com\"\n  variants={[\n    {\n      label: 'Default',\n      variant: 'components-textinput--default',\n    },\n    {\n      label: 'Fluid',\n      variant: 'components-textinput--fluid',\n    },\n    {\n      label: 'Read only',\n      variant: 'components-textinput--read-only',\n    },\n    {\n      label: 'Toggle password with visibility',\n      variant: 'components-textinput--toggle-password-visibility',\n    },\n    {\n      label: 'Fluid (unstable)',\n      variant: 'experimental-unstable-fluidtextinput--default',\n    },\n    {\n      label: 'Fluid with Tooltip (unstable)',\n      variant: 'experimental-unstable-fluidtextinput--default-with-tooltip',\n    },\n    {\n      label: 'Fluid with Password Input (unstable)',\n      variant: 'experimental-unstable-fluidtextinput--password-input',\n    },\n  ]}\n/>\n\n## Text input\n\nUse a text input when the expected user input is a single line of text. Text\ninputs have a fixed height and are used to enter simple free-form data entries\nwith any combination of letters, numbers, or symbols. There are two styles of\ntext input, default and fluid, which share the same functionality but look\nvisually different. The context of how or where the component is used will\ndictate which style to use.\n\n| Style   | Purpose                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |\n| ------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| Default | Default is the most commonly used text input style with the label and helper text outside the field. Use when white space is needed between input components or in productive moments where space is at a premium, and smaller components are needed. |\n| Fluid   | Fluid is an alternate styling for text input used in more expressive moments. Use in fluid forms, contained spaces, or attached to complex components, like a toolbar. Fluid components always sit flush with components around them.                 |\n\n### Anatomy\n\n<Row>\n<Column colLg={8}>\n\n<Tabs>\n\n<Tab label=\"Default\">\n\n![Anatomy of a text input in the default style](images/text-input-usage-anatomy-fixed.png)\n\n</Tab>\n\n<Tab label=\"Fluid\">\n\n![Anatomy of a text input in the fluid style](images/text-input-usage-anatomy-fluid.png)\n\n</Tab>\n\n</Tabs>\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\n1. **Label**: Text that informs the user about the content they need to enter in\n   the field. It is required unless you get an approved accessibility exemption.\n2. **Value**: The content the user has entered into the field.\n3. **Field**: The container in which a user enters data. Must meet 3:1 non-text\n   contrast requirements.\n4. **Helper text** (optional): Assistive text that can provide additional aid or\n   context to the user. Often used to explain the correct data format. It is\n   positioned below the field in the default style and surfaced through a\n   tooltip in the fluid style.\n\n### Sizing\n\n#### Default input heights\n\nThere are three text input height sizes: small, medium, and large. Supporting\nthree sizes gives you more flexibility in structuring layouts. Be sure to use a\nconsistent field height when pairing form components on the same page.\n\n| Size        | Height (px/rem) | Use case                                                                                                                                            |\n| ----------- | --------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| Small (sm)  | 32 / 2          | Use when space is constricted or when placing a text input in a form that is long and complex.                                                      |\n| Medium (md) | 40 / 2.5        | This is the default size and the most commonly used size. When in doubt, use the medium size.                                                       |\n| Large (lg)  | 48 / 3          | Use when there is a lot of space to work with. The large size is typically used in simple forms or when a text input is placed by itself on a page. |\n\n<Row>\n<Column colLg={8}>\n\n![Default text input heights](images/text-input-usage-size.png)\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\n#### Fluid input heights\n\nThere is only one fluid input height and it is visually larger than the default\nheights. The input is a set height expect for when a warning or error message\nhas been added to the bottom.\n\n<Row>\n<Column colLg={8}>\n\n![Fluid text input heights](images/text-input-usage-size-fluid.png)\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\n## Text area\n\nUse a text area when the expected user input is more than a few words and could\nspan multiple lines. It is commonly used for features like user commentary or\ndescriptions. It supports all the same states and functionality as text input\nexcept for the password functionality. Text area has several unique\nfunctionalities not included in the text input, like the resize handle and\ncharacter counter.\n\n| Style   | Purpose                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |\n| ------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| Default | Default is the most commonly used text area style with the label and helper text outside the field. Use when white space is needed between input components or in productive moments where space is at a premium, and smaller components are needed. |\n| Fluid   | Fluid is an alternate styling for text area used in more expressive moments. Use in fluid forms, contained spaces, or attached to complex components, like a toolbar. Fluid components always sit flush with components around them.                 |\n\n### Anatomy\n\n<Row>\n<Column colLg={8}>\n\n<Tabs>\n\n<Tab label=\"Default\">\n\n![Anatomy of a text area in the default style](images/text-area-usage-anatomy-fixed.png)\n\n</Tab>\n\n<Tab label=\"Fluid\">\n\n![Anatomy of a text area in the fluid style](images/text-area-usage-anatomy-fluid.png)\n\n</Tab>\n\n</Tabs>\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\n1. **Label**: Text that informs the user about the content they need to enter in\n   the field. It is required unless you get an approved accessibility exemption.\n2. **Value**: The content the user has entered into the field.\n3. **Field**: The container in which a user enters data. Must meet 3:1 non-text\n   contrast requirements.\n4. **Resize hanle**: Allows a user to manipulate the field height by making it\n   longer or shorter.\n5. **Optional versus required indicator** (optional): This label indicates if\n   the field is optional or required for the user to complete.\n6. **Character counter** (optional): Indicate the number of characters being\n   entered and the total number of characters allowed.\n\n### Sizing\n\nText area has a variable height that can be lengthened or shortened by the user\nusing the resize handle in the bottom right of the field. By default, text area\nhas a minimum height of 40px/2.5rem but no maximum height.\n\n#### Resize handle\n\nIncluded by default in both default and fluid text area is the resize handle. It\nallows a user to manipulate the field height by making it longer or shorter. The\nresize handle has no effect on the width of the text area container, it only\neffects the height. If the user makes the field size shorter than the content\ninside the field then a vertical scroll will become available.\n\n<Row>\n<Column colLg={8}>\n\n![Example showing the resize handle in text area](images/text-area-usage-resize.png)\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\n## Formatting\n\n### Alignment\n\nInput labels should vertically align to the grid and with other type elements on\nthe page. The alignment of the input container will differ based on the style of\ntext input you are using. Default inputs are always flush to the columns and\nfluid inputs will hang into the gutters.\n\n<DoDontRow>\n  <DoDont caption=\"Align default input containers to the grid so the input label alignes with other type of the page.\">\n\n![Do align field containers to the grid.](images/text-input-usage-4-do.png)\n\n  </DoDont>\n  <DoDont caption=\"Hang fluid input containers into the gutters so the input label alignes with other type of the page.\">\n\n![Do hang fluid field containers to the gutter.](images/text-input-usage-4-do-fluid.png)\n\n  </DoDont>\n</DoDontRow>\n\n#### Placement\n\nThe field widths of both text input and text area should reflect the intended\nlength of the content while still aligning to the grid columns or mini unit\ngrid. Unlike the height, the width of the text area cannot be controlled by the\nuser. There are no minimum or maximum widths but you should avoid excessively\nwide fields that are disproportionate to the intended data being collected.\n\n<DoDontRow>\n  <DoDont type=\"do\" caption=\"Do make text input widths proportional to the content and align to grid columns.\">\n\n![Do use proportional widths](images/text-input-width-do.png)\n\n  </DoDont>\n  <DoDont type=\"dont\" caption=\"Do not make text inputs excessively wide just to fill in space. \">\n\n![Do not make inputs excessively wide.](images/text-input-width-dont.png)\n\n  </DoDont>\n</DoDontRow>\n\n### Alignment\n\nLabels and field containers should vertically align to the grid and with other\nform components on a page.\n\n<DoDontRow>\n  <DoDont type=\"do\" caption=\"Do align field containers to the grid.\">\n\n![Do align field containers to the grid.](images/text-input-usage-4-do.png)\n\n  </DoDont>\n  <DoDont type=\"dont\" caption=\"Do not align field text to the grid and hang the field in the gutter.\">\n\n![Do not align field text to the grid and hang the field in the gutter.](images/text-input-usage-4-dont.png)\n\n  </DoDont>\n</DoDontRow>\n\n## Content\n\n### Main elements\n\n#### Labels\n\nEffective labeling helps users understand what information to enter into a text\ninput. Text fields should always have a label. There are rare instances were the\ncontext of an input negates the need for a visible label but we advise you\nconsult an accessibility expert before proceeding with a label-less design.\n\n- Use sentence-style capitalization for all labels, except for product names and\n  proper nouns.\n- Keep the label short and concise.\n- Do not use colons after label names.\n\n#### Helper text\n\nOptional helper text is pertinent information that assists the user in correctly\ncompleting a field. It is often used to explain the correct data format.\n\n- Use sentence-style capitalization, and in most cases, write the text as full\n  sentences with punctuation.\n- When used, helper text appears persistently underneath the field, except when\n  an error or warning message replaces it.\n\n#### Placeholder text\n\nOptional placeholder text provides hints or examples of what to enter.\nPlaceholder text disappears after the user begins entering data into the input.\nAs such, it should not be used as a replacement for a persistent label nor\nshould it contain crucial information.\n\n- Use sentence-style capitalization, and in most cases, write the text as a\n  direct statement without punctuation.\n- Placeholder text is not required and by default not shown in text input\n  fields.\n- Placeholder text can be harmful to user interactions and should only be added\n  when necessary.\n\n### Overflow content\n\n#### Overflow in a text input\n\nIf a user's content is unexpectedly too long for the single line of a text input\nthen the value content can horizontally scroll inside the field container when\nmoving the cursor from one end of the value to the other.\n\n#### Overflow in a text area\n\nIf a user's content exceeds the vertical space of the variable text area then a\nuser can either expand the field container using the resize handle or they can\nvertically scroll the content inside the set field container.\n\n### Further guidance\n\nFor further content guidance, see Carbon's\n[content guidelines](/guidelines/content/overview).\n\n## Universal behaviors\n\nThe behaviors listed in this section are universal across all variants. For\nbehaviors that are unique to each variant, see each of the component variant\nsections below.\n\n### States\n\nThe text input and text area have multiple interactive states: **enabled**,\n**active**, **focus**, **error**, **warning**, **disabled**, **skeleton**, and\n**read-only**. For more details on text input and text area interactive states,\nsee the [style tab](https://carbondesignsystem.com/components/text-input/style).\n\n| State       | When to use                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |\n| ----------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| _Enabled_   | When a text input or text area is live but a user is not directly interacting with it. This is commonly referred to as the default or normal state of the component. An enabled text input field can contain no content, placeholder text, or user generate content.                          |\n| _Active_    | When a user is actively typing content into the field.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |\n| _Focus_     | When a user `tabs` to or clicks on the text input or text area, it becomes focused, indicating the user has successfully navigated to the component.                                                                                                                                          |\n| _Error_     | When the user input is invalid or a required text input or text area has not been filled in. It can also be triggered due to a system error. This state requires a user response before data can be submitted or saved.                                                                       |\n| _Warning_   | When you need to call the user's attention to an exception condition. The condition might not be an error but can cause problems if not resolved.                                                                                                                                             |\n| _Disabled_  | When the user cannot interact with a component and all interactive functions have been removed. Unlike read-only states, disabled states are not focusable, are not read by screen readers, and do not need to pass visual contrast, making them inaccessible if they need to be interpreted. |\n| _Skeleton_  | Use on an initial page load to indicate that the text input or text area has not yet fully loaded.                                                                                                                                                                                            |\n| _Read-only_ | When the user can review but not modify the component. This state removes all interactive functions like the disabled state but can still be focusable, accessible by screen readers, and passes visual contrast for readability.                                                             |\n\n### Validation\n\nReal-time validation helps streamline the process and keep data clean when the\nuser fills out forms. Otherwise, validate the text input data when the user\nsubmits the associated form. For complete guidance on error and validation, see\nthe [form pattern](https://carbondesignsystem.com/patterns/forms-pattern/).\n\n#### Invalid\n\nAn error state is triggered if the data is invalid or a required field is left\nempty. Error states have three visual indicators to signify invalid content: a\nred border, an error icon indicator, and an error message.\n\n<Row>\n<Column colLg={8}>\n\n![Example of an error state being triggered](images/text-input-usage-2.gif)\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\n### Required versus optional\n\nText inputs can be labeled as either optional or required depending on the\ndepending on the circumstance. For more guidance on requirement labeling, see\nthe [form pattern](/patterns/forms-pattern/#optional-vs.-mandatory).\n\n<DoDontRow>\n<DoDont\ntype=\"do\"\ncolMd={4} colLg={4}\ncaption=\"If the majority of the fields are required, mark only the optional field labels with (optional).\">\n\n![Example showing optional field indicator](./images/text-input-usage-optional-do.png)\n\n</DoDont>\n<DoDont\ntype=\"do\"\ncolMd={4} colLg={4}\ncaption=\"If the majority of the fields are optional, mark only the required field labels with (required).\">\n\n![Example showing required field indicator](./images/text-input-usage-required-do.png)\n\n</DoDont>\n</DoDontRow>\n\n### Interactions\n\n#### Mouse\n\nUsers can activate a text input by clicking on the field container. A separate\nclick is required to activate any additional actions associated with the text\ninput such as a password visibility toggle.\n\n<Row>\n<Column colLg={8}>\n\n<Tabs>\n\n<Tab label=\"Default\">\n\n![Example showing click target areas for text input in the default style](images/text-input-usage-mouse-fixed.png)\n\n</Tab>\n\n<Tab label=\"Fluid\">\n\n![Example showing click target areas for text input in the fluid style](images/text-input-usage-mouse-fluid.png)\n\n</Tab>\n\n</Tabs>\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\n#### Keyboard\n\nFor additional keyboard interactions, see the\n[accessibility tab](/components/text-input/accessibility).\n\n| Key                                   | Interaction                                                                            |\n| ------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| _Tab_                                 | Brings focus to the text input.                                                        |\n| _Enter_ or _Space_                    | Opens any associated actions added to the input, such as a password visibility toggle. |\n| _Esc_                                 | Closes any associated actions added to the input.                                      |\n| _ctrl_ or _opt_ + _left/right arrows_ | Moves you word by word inside the field.                                               |\n| _ctrl_ or _opt_ + _up/down arrows_    | Relocates you to the start or end of the input content.                                |\n\n## Modifiers\n\n### Password input\n\nPassword input is a sub-variant of text input. It is used to collect private\ndata and will hide the characters as a user enters them. A user can choose to\ntoggle on the character visibility by clicking the view icon on the far right of\nthe input field. When using a password input be sure to provide detailed helper\ntext listing any requirements related to the data format, such as types of\ncharacters allowed or date structure.\n\n<Row>\n<Column colLg={8}>\n\n![Example of a password input](images/text-input-usage-password.png)\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\n### Character counter\n\nA character counter can be added to text area to indicate both the number of\ncharacters being entered and the total number of characters allowed.

The type of text field\nused should reflect the length of the content you expect the user to enter. The\ndefault text input is for short, one-line content, whereas text area is for\nlonger, multi-line entries.\n\n<Row>\n<Column colLg={8}>\n\n![Text input and text area example](images/text-input-usage-2.png)\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\n#### When to use\n\n- A user needs to input unique information that cannot be predicted with a\n  preset of options.\n- A user needs to input memorable data that can be entered more quickly in a\n  free-hand format versus a more complex control.\n\n#### When not to use\n\n- If a user can only enter an option from a predefined list then avoid using a\n  free-form text input as it is likely to result in an error. Consider using a\n  selection control such as a dropdown, select, or radio button group instead.\n\n### Variants\n\n| Variant                                                | Purpose                                                                               |\n| ------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| [Text input](/components/text-input/usage/#text-input) | When the expected user input is a single line of text.                                |\n| [Text area](/components/text-input/usage/#text-area)   | When the expected user input is more than a few words that could span multiple lines. |\n\n## Live demo\n\n<StorybookDemo\n  themeSelector\n  url=\"https://react.carbondesignsystem.com\"\n  variants={[\n    {\n      label: 'Default',\n      variant: 'components-textinput--default',\n    },\n    {\n      label: 'Fluid',\n      variant: 'components-textinput--fluid',\n    },\n    {\n      label: 'Read only',\n      variant: 'components-textinput--read-only',\n    },\n    {\n      label: 'Toggle password with visibility',\n      variant: 'components-textinput--toggle-password-visibility',\n    },\n    {\n      label: 'Fluid (unstable)',\n      variant: 'experimental-unstable-fluidtextinput--default',\n    },\n    {\n      label: 'Fluid with Tooltip (unstable)',\n      variant: 'experimental-unstable-fluidtextinput--default-with-tooltip',\n    },\n    {\n      label: 'Fluid with Password Input (unstable)',\n      variant: 'experimental-unstable-fluidtextinput--password-input',\n    },\n  ]}\n/>\n\n## Text input\n\nUse a text input when the expected user input is a single line of text. Text\ninputs have a fixed height and are used to enter simple free-form data entries\nwith any combination of letters, numbers, or symbols. There are two styles of\ntext input, default and fluid, which share the same functionality but look\nvisually different. The context of how or where the component is used will\ndictate which style to use.\n\n| Style   | Purpose                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |\n| ------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| Default | Default is the most commonly used text input style with the label and helper text outside the field. Use when white space is needed between input components or in productive moments where space is at a premium, and smaller components are needed. |\n| Fluid   | Fluid is an alternate styling for text input used in more expressive moments. Use in fluid forms, contained spaces, or attached to complex components, like a toolbar. Fluid components always sit flush with components around them.                 |\n\n### Anatomy\n\n<Row>\n<Column colLg={8}>\n\n<Tabs>\n\n<Tab label=\"Default\">\n\n![Anatomy of a text input in the default style](images/text-input-usage-anatomy-fixed.png)\n\n</Tab>\n\n<Tab label=\"Fluid\">\n\n![Anatomy of a text input in the fluid style](images/text-input-usage-anatomy-fluid.png)\n\n</Tab>\n\n</Tabs>\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\n1. **Label**: Text that informs the user about the content they need to enter in\n   the field. It is required unless you get an approved accessibility exemption.\n2. **Value**: The content the user has entered into the field.\n3. **Field**: The container in which a user enters data. Must meet 3:1 non-text\n   contrast requirements.\n4. **Helper text** (optional): Assistive text that can provide additional aid or\n   context to the user. Often used to explain the correct data format. It is\n   positioned below the field in the default style and surfaced through a\n   tooltip in the fluid style.\n\n### Sizing\n\n#### Default input heights\n\nThere are three text input height sizes: small, medium, and large. Supporting\nthree sizes gives you more flexibility in structuring layouts. Be sure to use a\nconsistent field height when pairing form components on the same page.\n\n| Size        | Height (px/rem) | Use case                                                                                                                                            |\n| ----------- | --------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| Small (sm)  | 32 / 2          | Use when space is constricted or when placing a text input in a form that is long and complex.                                                      |\n| Medium (md) | 40 / 2.5        | This is the default size and the most commonly used size. When in doubt, use the medium size.                                                       |\n| Large (lg)  | 48 / 3          | Use when there is a lot of space to work with. The large size is typically used in simple forms or when a text input is placed by itself on a page. |\n\n<Row>\n<Column colLg={8}>\n\n![Default text input heights](images/text-input-usage-size.png)\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\n#### Fluid input heights\n\nThere is only one fluid input height and it is visually larger than the default\nheights. The input is a set height expect for when a warning or error message\nhas been added to the bottom.\n\n<Row>\n<Column colLg={8}>\n\n![Fluid text input heights](images/text-input-usage-size-fluid.png)\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\n## Text area\n\nUse a text area when the expected user input is more than a few words and could\nspan multiple lines. It is commonly used for features like user commentary or\ndescriptions. It supports all the same states and functionality as text input\nexcept for the password functionality. Text area has several unique\nfunctionalities not included in the text input, like the resize handle and\ncharacter counter.\n\n| Style   | Purpose                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |\n| ------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| Default | Default is the most commonly used text area style with the label and helper text outside the field. Use when white space is needed between input components or in productive moments where space is at a premium, and smaller components are needed. |\n| Fluid   | Fluid is an alternate styling for text area used in more expressive moments. Use in fluid forms, contained spaces, or attached to complex components, like a toolbar. Fluid components always sit flush with components around them.                 |\n\n### Anatomy\n\n<Row>\n<Column colLg={8}>\n\n<Tabs>\n\n<Tab label=\"Default\">\n\n![Anatomy of a text area in the default style](images/text-area-usage-anatomy-fixed.png)\n\n</Tab>\n\n<Tab label=\"Fluid\">\n\n![Anatomy of a text area in the fluid style](images/text-area-usage-anatomy-fluid.png)\n\n</Tab>\n\n</Tabs>\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\n1. **Label**: Text that informs the user about the content they need to enter in\n   the field. It is required unless you get an approved accessibility exemption.\n2. **Value**: The content the user has entered into the field.\n3. **Field**: The container in which a user enters data. Must meet 3:1 non-text\n   contrast requirements.\n4. **Resize hanle**: Allows a user to manipulate the field height by making it\n   longer or shorter.\n5. **Optional versus required indicator** (optional): This label indicates if\n   the field is optional or required for the user to complete.\n6. **Character counter** (optional): Indicate the number of characters being\n   entered and the total number of characters allowed.\n\n### Sizing\n\nText area has a variable height that can be lengthened or shortened by the user\nusing the resize handle in the bottom right of the field. By default, text area\nhas a minimum height of 40px/2.5rem but no maximum height.\n\n#### Resize handle\n\nIncluded by default in both default and fluid text area is the resize handle. It\nallows a user to manipulate the field height by making it longer or shorter. The\nresize handle has no effect on the width of the text area container, it only\neffects the height. If the user makes the field size shorter than the content\ninside the field then a vertical scroll will become available.\n\n<Row>\n<Column colLg={8}>\n\n![Example showing the resize handle in text area](images/text-area-usage-resize.png)\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\n## Formatting\n\n### Alignment\n\nInput labels should vertically align to the grid and with other type elements on\nthe page. The alignment of the input container will differ based on the style of\ntext input you are using. Default inputs are always flush to the columns and\nfluid inputs will hang into the gutters.\n\n<DoDontRow>\n  <DoDont caption=\"Align default input containers to the grid so the input label alignes with other type of the page.\">\n\n![Do align field containers to the grid.](images/text-input-usage-4-do.png)\n\n  </DoDont>\n  <DoDont caption=\"Hang fluid input containers into the gutters so the input label alignes with other type of the page.\">\n\n![Do hang fluid field containers to the gutter.](images/text-input-usage-4-do-fluid.png)\n\n  </DoDont>\n</DoDontRow>\n\n#### Placement\n\nThe field widths of both text input and text area should reflect the intended\nlength of the content while still aligning to the grid columns or mini unit\ngrid. Unlike the height, the width of the text area cannot be controlled by the\nuser. There are no minimum or maximum widths but you should avoid excessively\nwide fields that are disproportionate to the intended data being collected.\n\n<DoDontRow>\n  <DoDont type=\"do\" caption=\"Do make text input widths proportional to the content and align to grid columns.\">\n\n![Do use proportional widths](images/text-input-width-do.png)\n\n  </DoDont>\n  <DoDont type=\"dont\" caption=\"Do not make text inputs excessively wide just to fill in space. \">\n\n![Do not make inputs excessively wide.](images/text-input-width-dont.png)\n\n  </DoDont>\n</DoDontRow>\n\n### Alignment\n\nLabels and field containers should vertically align to the grid and with other\nform components on a page.\n\n<DoDontRow>\n  <DoDont type=\"do\" caption=\"Do align field containers to the grid.\">\n\n![Do align field containers to the grid.](images/text-input-usage-4-do.png)\n\n  </DoDont>\n  <DoDont type=\"dont\" caption=\"Do not align field text to the grid and hang the field in the gutter.\">\n\n![Do not align field text to the grid and hang the field in the gutter.](images/text-input-usage-4-dont.png)\n\n  </DoDont>\n</DoDontRow>\n\n## Content\n\n### Main elements\n\n#### Labels\n\nEffective labeling helps users understand what information to enter into a text\ninput. Text fields should always have a label. There are rare instances were the\ncontext of an input negates the need for a visible label but we advise you\nconsult an accessibility expert before proceeding with a label-less design.\n\n- Use sentence-style capitalization for all labels, except for product names and\n  proper nouns.\n- Keep the label short and concise.\n- Do not use colons after label names.\n\n#### Helper text\n\nOptional helper text is pertinent information that assists the user in correctly\ncompleting a field. It is often used to explain the correct data format.\n\n- Use sentence-style capitalization, and in most cases, write the text as full\n  sentences with punctuation.\n- When used, helper text appears persistently underneath the field, except when\n  an error or warning message replaces it.\n\n#### Placeholder text\n\nOptional placeholder text provides hints or examples of what to enter.\nPlaceholder text disappears after the user begins entering data into the input.\nAs such, it should not be used as a replacement for a persistent label nor\nshould it contain crucial information.\n\n- Use sentence-style capitalization, and in most cases, write the text as a\n  direct statement without punctuation.\n- Placeholder text is not required and by default not shown in text input\n  fields.\n- Placeholder text can be harmful to user interactions and should only be added\n  when necessary.\n\n### Overflow content\n\n#### Overflow in a text input\n\nIf a user's content is unexpectedly too long for the single line of a text input\nthen the value content can horizontally scroll inside the field container when\nmoving the cursor from one end of the value to the other.\n\n#### Overflow in a text area\n\nIf a user's content exceeds the vertical space of the variable text area then a\nuser can either expand the field container using the resize handle or they can\nvertically scroll the content inside the set field container.\n\n### Further guidance\n\nFor further content guidance, see Carbon's\n[content guidelines](/guidelines/content/overview).\n\n## Universal behaviors\n\nThe behaviors listed in this section are universal across all variants. For\nbehaviors that are unique to each variant, see each of the component variant\nsections below.\n\n### States\n\nThe text input and text area have multiple interactive states: **enabled**,\n**active**, **focus**, **error**, **warning**, **disabled**, **skeleton**, and\n**read-only**. For more details on text input and text area interactive states,\nsee the [style tab](https://carbondesignsystem.com/components/text-input/style).\n\n| State       | When to use                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |\n| ----------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| _Enabled_   | When a text input or text area is live but a user is not directly interacting with it. This is commonly referred to as the default or normal state of the component. An enabled text input field can contain no content, placeholder text, or user generate content.                          |\n| _Active_    | When a user is actively typing content into the field.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |\n| _Focus_     | When a user `tabs` to or clicks on the text input or text area, it becomes focused, indicating the user has successfully navigated to the component.                                                                                                                                          |\n| _Error_     | When the user input is invalid or a required text input or text area has not been filled in. It can also be triggered due to a system error. This state requires a user response before data can be submitted or saved.                                                                       |\n| _Warning_   | When you need to call the user's attention to an exception condition. The condition might not be an error but can cause problems if not resolved.                                                                                                                                             |\n| _Disabled_  | When the user cannot interact with a component and all interactive functions have been removed. Unlike read-only states, disabled states are not focusable, are not read by screen readers, and do not need to pass visual contrast, making them inaccessible if they need to be interpreted. |\n| _Skeleton_  | Use on an initial page load to indicate that the text input or text area has not yet fully loaded.                                                                                                                                                                                            |\n| _Read-only_ | When the user can review but not modify the component. This state removes all interactive functions like the disabled state but can still be focusable, accessible by screen readers, and passes visual contrast for readability.                                                             |\n\n### Validation\n\nReal-time validation helps streamline the process and keep data clean when the\nuser fills out forms. Otherwise, validate the text input data when the user\nsubmits the associated form. For complete guidance on error and validation, see\nthe [form pattern](https://carbondesignsystem.com/patterns/forms-pattern/).\n\n#### Invalid\n\nAn error state is triggered if the data is invalid or a required field is left\nempty. Error states have three visual indicators to signify invalid content: a\nred border, an error icon indicator, and an error message.\n\n<Row>\n<Column colLg={8}>\n\n![Example of an error state being triggered](images/text-input-usage-2.gif)\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\n### Required versus optional\n\nText inputs can be labeled as either optional or required depending on the\ndepending on the circumstance. For more guidance on requirement labeling, see\nthe [form pattern](/patterns/forms-pattern/#optional-vs.-mandatory).\n\n<DoDontRow>\n<DoDont\ntype=\"do\"\ncolMd={4} colLg={4}\ncaption=\"If the majority of the fields are required, mark only the optional field labels with (optional).\">\n\n![Example showing optional field indicator](./images/text-input-usage-optional-do.png)\n\n</DoDont>\n<DoDont\ntype=\"do\"\ncolMd={4} colLg={4}\ncaption=\"If the majority of the fields are optional, mark only the required field labels with (required).\">\n\n![Example showing required field indicator](./images/text-input-usage-required-do.png)\n\n</DoDont>\n</DoDontRow>\n\n### Interactions\n\n#### Mouse\n\nUsers can activate a text input by clicking on the field container. A separate\nclick is required to activate any additional actions associated with the text\ninput such as a password visibility toggle.\n\n<Row>\n<Column colLg={8}>\n\n<Tabs>\n\n<Tab label=\"Default\">\n\n![Example showing click target areas for text input in the default style](images/text-input-usage-mouse-fixed.png)\n\n</Tab>\n\n<Tab label=\"Fluid\">\n\n![Example showing click target areas for text input in the fluid style](images/text-input-usage-mouse-fluid.png)\n\n</Tab>\n\n</Tabs>\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\n#### Keyboard\n\nFor additional keyboard interactions, see the\n[accessibility tab](/components/text-input/accessibility).\n\n| Key                                   | Interaction                                                                            |\n| ------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| _Tab_                                 | Brings focus to the text input.                                                        |\n| _Enter_ or _Space_                    | Opens any associated actions added to the input, such as a password visibility toggle. |\n| _Esc_                                 | Closes any associated actions added to the input.                                      |\n| _ctrl_ or _opt_ + _left/right arrows_ | Moves you word by word inside the field.                                               |\n| _ctrl_ or _opt_ + _up/down arrows_    | Relocates you to the start or end of the input content.                                |\n\n## Modifiers\n\n### Password input\n\nPassword input is a sub-variant of text input. It is used to collect private\ndata and will hide the characters as a user enters them.
