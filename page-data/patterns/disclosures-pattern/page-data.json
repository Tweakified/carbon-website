Unlike tooltips, the content expanded by a disclosure may\ncontain interactive elements.\n\nAt its core, a disclosure is comprised of two parts—a trigger that the user\ninteracts with by clicking or using their keyboard and the container that opens\nand discloses the content.\n\n### When to use\n\n- Use when disclosing additional content about part of a UI.\n- Use when there is a need to include interactive elements in a popover.\n- Use to show settings, filtering, or sorting menus that affect sections of a\n  page, for example in data tables, or an entire page.\n- Use when displaying content within types of dropdowns, for example profile\n  menus, combo buttons, and menu buttons.\n\n### When not to use\n\n- Don't use to present critical information or request required input needed to\n  complete a workflow. Use the\n  [modal component](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/components/modal/usage/)\n  instead.\n- Don’t use when the user hasn’t explicitly triggered the popover to open on\n  click.\n- Don't use if the popover needs to have a width larger than six columns.\n\n### Best practices\n\n#### Keep disclosures at a reasonable size\n\nA disclosure should not take up a considerable amount of the size of the screen.\nDisclosures are meant to be smaller moments that can open on top of different\nareas of a page. They should not seem like a disruption to the users workflow\nand should not act as a screen takeover. Keep all content in a disclosure\nconcise and only include information that is necessary. We recommend having a\nwidth of six columns or less.\n\n#### Disclosures should be user initiated\n\nDisclosures should always be triggered to open or close by the user. Disclosures\nshould never open automatically because this could be potentially intrusive to\nthe user's workflow.\n\n#### One disclosure should open at a time\n\nIf there are multiple instances on a page where a disclosure is present, only\none should open at a time to avoid screen clutter and to help the user stay\nfocused on the information being disclosed.\n\n<DoDontRow>\n<DoDont\ntype=\"do\"\ncaption=\"Do have one disclosure open at a time.\">\n\n![Do have one disclosure open at a time.](./images/disclosure-one-at-a-time-do.png)\n\n</DoDont>\n\n<DoDont\ntype=\"dont\"\ncaption=\"Do not have multiple disclosures open at the same time.\">\n\n![Do not have multiple disclosures open at the same time.](./images/disclosure-one-at-a-time-dont.png)\n\n</DoDont>\n</DoDontRow>\n\n#### Avoid nesting disclosures\n\nDo not nest one disclosure within another disclosure. Nesting disclosures\ncreates a stacking effect and could confuse the user of where they should be\nfocusing their attention and which disclosure they should be interacting with.\nUsing submenus in a context menu that fly out to the sides is an acceptable way\nto disclose additional information in a disclosure.\n\n#### Do not hide critical information within a disclosure\n\nDo not hide important information inside of a disclosure that the user may need\nin order to complete a task or workflow. Keep critical information at a higher\nlevel so the user has better visibility.\n\n### Behaviors\n\n**Opening and closing a disclosure**\n\nTo open a disclosure to reveal its content, click the trigger button it is\nrelated to. If using a keyboard, press `Enter` or `Space`.\n\nTo close a disclosure, either click on the trigger button again, click anywhere\noutside of the open disclosure container or click on the close `x` icon if it is\npresent within the disclosure. If using a keyboard, press `Esc` or `Tab` to tab\nout of the disclosure.\n\n#### Dismissible action\n\nDepending on the type of content in a disclosure, it can be useful to display a\nclose `x` icon. Be mindful when and where you place a close icon in a\ndisclosure. The close icon should always be in the top right corner of the\npopover and should not interfere or overlap with inline interactive elements.\n\n<DoDontRow>\n<DoDont\ntype=\"do\"\ncaption=\"Do place a close icon in the upper right hand corner in an empty space.\">\n\n![Do place a close icon in the upper right hand corner in an empty space.](./images/disclosure-dismmisible-do.png)\n\n</DoDont>\n\n<DoDont\ntype=\"dont\"\ncaption=\"Do not place a close icon inline with interactive elements.\">\n\n![Do not place a close icon inline with interactive elements.](./images/disclosure-dismmisible-dont.png)\n\n</DoDont>\n</DoDontRow>\n\n### Visual guidance\n\n#### Trigger button container\n\nA disclosure is controlled by a trigger button. The trigger button can visually\nchange its shape and size depending on the usecase.\n\nThe trigger button can use any of our button types and can be set at these three\nsizes—48px (lg), 40px (md) or 32px (sm).\n\n<Row>\n<Column colLg={8}>\n\n![Example of trigger button container height sizes.](images/disclosure-button-container-size.png)\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\n<Caption>Example of trigger button container height sizes.</Caption>\n\n#### Trigger button icon\n\nIf a trigger button contains an icon, the icon size should be either 20px or\n16px.\n\n<Row>\n<Column colLg={8}>\n\n![Example of trigger button icon sizes.](images/disclosure-button-icon-size.png)\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\n<Caption>Example of trigger button icon sizes.</Caption>\n\n#### Popover\n\nA popover component is used as the underlying layer of a disclosure to disclose\nits content. See the\n[popover component](https://v11.carbondesignsystem.com/components/popover/usage/)\nguidance for more information.\n\n<Row>\n<Column colLg={8}>\n\n![Example of a popover container.](images/disclosure-popover.png)\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\n<Caption>Example of a popover container.</Caption>\n\n### Content\n\nThe type of content in a disclosure can vary depending on the use case. A\ndisclosure can be simple and contain solely informational text. In some cases\ncontent can be more complex and include a combination of multiple sections and\ninteractive elements. Below are some common examples and best practices of how\nto show body text, heading text, and footer content in disclosures.\n\n#### Heading text\n\nHeading text can be placed above body text in a disclosure. Placing the heading\ntext with 0px padding above the body text or adding a divider between the\nheading text and body text are two different common use cases.\n\n<Row>\n<Column colLg={8}>\n\n![Example of a disclosure with heading text.](images/disclosure-heading-text.png)\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\n<Caption>Example of a disclosure with heading text.</Caption>\n\n#### Footer content\n\nFooter content can be placed below the body text it is related to. Placing the\nfooter content with 16px padding below the body text or adding a divider between\nthe footer content and body text are two different common use cases.\n\n<Row>\n<Column colLg={8}>\n\n![Example of a disclosure with footer content.](images/disclosure-footer-content.png)\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\n<Caption>Example of a disclosure with footer content.</Caption>\n\n#### Multiple sections of text\n\nDepending on the use case, you may need a disclosure to show multiple sections\nof content. Use padding or dividers to visually create sections. Profile menus\nand context menus typically display multiple sections of content depending on\nthe complexity of the menu.\n\n<Row>\n<Column colLg={8}>\n\n![Example of a disclosure with multiple sections.](images/disclosure-multiple-sections.png)\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\n<Caption>Example of a disclosure with multiple sections.</Caption>\n\n#### Interactive elements\n\nDisclosures allow you to place interactive elements in a popover while still\nkeeping it accessible. Settings and filters often include components like radio\nbuttons and checkboxes that the user can interact with to adjust specific\ncontent. Searching within a menu is another common use case of including\ninteractive elements within a popover.\n\n<Row>\n<Column colLg={8}>\n\n![Example of a disclosure with interactive content.](images/disclosure-interactive-elements.png)\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\n<Caption>Example of a disclosure with interactive content.</Caption>\n\n## Common use cases\n\nDisclosures are used for a wide variety of use cases. The following variants are\na few examples of common disclosures that you may come across frequently in\nproduct interfaces.\n\n| Example                   | Use cases                                                                                                                                                                                                              |\n| ------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| Profile menu              | Profile menus are typically part of a UI shell header and can have navigational options related to a user's account or active session.                                                                                 |\n| Settings and filter menus | Settings and filter menus are frequently used within data table toolbars to enable users to adjust content. Filter and sort menus can also be used for filtering large amounts of content on a page or an entire page. |\n| Combo button              | Combo buttons are used to contain multiple related actions that come with a default, primary action. Additional actions live in the menu.                                                                              |\n\n## Profile menu\n\nProfile menus follow the disclosure pattern by clicking an icon button that\nopens a popover. Profile menus are essential to a product's UI and users rely on\nit to find global content related to their account, product, and active session\ninformation. Profile menus provide a way to log in or out of an account and let\nusers access their settings. Additional links and icons can be added to a\nprofile menu depending on the use case.\n\nSee the\n[profile menu pattern](https://pages.github.ibm.com/cdai-design/pal/patterns/profile-header-menu/)\nfor more information.\n\n### Anatomy\n\n<Row>\n<Column colLg={8}>\n\n![Anatomy of a profile menu.](images/disclosures-profile-menu-anatomy.png)\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\n<Caption>Anatomy of a profile menu.</Caption>\n\n1. **Toolbar profile image:** A profile image, initials, or icon of a user.\n2. **Menu profile image:** A profile image that is paired with high level\n   information about the user, such as a name or handle.\n3. **Section dividers (optional):** To group related content by creating visual\n   sections.\n4. **Contextual information (optional):** Global information that is related to\n   the account or active session.\n5. **Link (optional):** Additional links that are not main menu items. Links can\n   be used for editing, prompting a modal, etc.\n6. **Menu items:** The main and most commonly used menu items that are\n   navigational.\n7. **Icon (optional):** Additional icons to place inline with menu items.\n\n### Structure\n\nA profile menu is made up of two parts—an icon button and a popover. Profile\nmenus support a variety of content that can range in complexity. Some profile\nmenus are simple while other menus may be more complex and require multiple\nsections of information. Profile menus that are complex may benefit from\nincluding interactive elements depending on the use case.\n\n<Row>\n<Column colLg={12}>\n\n![Example of a simple and complex profile menu.](images/disclosures-profile-menu-simple-complex.png)\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\n<Caption>Example of a simple and complex profile menu.</Caption>\n\n### Functionality\n\n#### Mouse\n\nClicking the icon button triggers the profile menu to open and reveals\ninformation related to the users profile and account. The user can then click on\nmenu items and other interactive elements within the menu. To close the menu,\nclick on the icon button trigger again or anywhere on the page out side of the\nmenu.\n\n<Row>\n<Column colLg={8}>\n\n![Example of a closed and opened profile menu.](images/disclosures-profile-menu-structure.png)\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\n#### Keyboard\n\n- `Tab` to the icon button trigger to apply focus.\n- To open the profile menu press `Enter` or `Space`.\n- Once opened, focus goes to the first item in the menu.\n- To navigate the profile menu items press the `Up` and `Down` arrow keys.\n- To select an item in the profile menu press `Enter`.\n- To close the profile menu press `Esc` .\n\n### Best practices\n\n#### Use with a global toolbar header\n\nIf a product has a global toolbar header and offers login capabilities, use the\nprofile menu. Provide a way for the user to log out of an account, make changes\nto profile information, or navigate to settings.\n\n#### Show information that is pertinent to the user account or session\n\nInclude sections on a global contextual level that may be helpful to the user to\nsee in the profile menu. For example, indicating the current plan or location\nwith an option to edit or change the current information can be valuable to\ninclude in a profile menu depending on the use case.\n\n#### Add icons and links to help guide the user\n\nWhen appropriate, pair icons with related menu items or information to indicate\nthe action that will be performed once it is clicked. Provide links next to\nrelated menu items or information to specify there are additional quick actions\nto take, whether it be upgrading an account plan or changing a location. Only\nadd icons and links to a profile menu if completely necessary in order to not\noverwhelm the user and to reduce visual clutter within the menu.\n\n## Settings and filter menus\n\nSettings and filters follow the disclosure pattern by clicking an icon button\nthat opens a popover. Interactive elements are often found in settings and\nfilters in order to modify or adjust specific content. The disclosure pattern\nallows you to nest interactive elements inside of a popover while still being\naccessible.\n\n### Anatomy\n\n<Row>\n<Column colLg={8}>\n\n![Anatomy of a settings menu.](images/disclosures-settings-anatomy.png)\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\n<Caption>Anatomy of a settings menu.</Caption>\n\n1. **Icon button:** A trigger to open and close the popover.\n2. **Popover:** Uses the popover component as an underlying layer.\n3. **Content area:** Area to place text and interactive elements.\n4. **Button group:** To cancel or apply changes in settings or filters that\n   affect other content on the page.\n\n### Structure\n\nSettings or filter menus are made up of two parts—an icon button and a popover.\nThese types of menus usually contain interactive elements. For example, use\nbuttons to clear filters, use checkboxes, radio buttons, or dropdowns to adjust\ncontent and use sets of buttons to reset or apply changes. Content may vary\ndepending on what is being filtered, sorted, or what settings need to be\ndefined.\n\n<Row>\n<Column colLg={8}>\n\n![Example of a filter menu structure.](images/disclosures-settings-structure.png)\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\n<Caption>Example of a filter menu structure</Caption>\n\n### Functionality\n\n#### Mouse\n\nClicking the icon button triggers the popover to open. Upon opening the menu,\nthe first interactive element in the menu receives focus. To close the menu\nclick on the icon button again, or anywhere on the page outside of the menu.\n\n<Row>\n<Column colLg={8}>\n\n![Example of a closed and opened filter menu.](images/disclosures-settings-functionality.png)\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\n<Caption>Example of a closed and opened filter menu.</Caption>\n\n#### Keyboard\n\n- `Tab` to the icon button trigger to apply focus.\n- To open the settings or filter menu press `Enter` or `Space`.\n- Upon opening the menu, the first interactive element in the menu receives\n  focus.\n- To shift focus to different interactive elements in the menu press the `Tab`\n  or `Shift` + `Tab`.\n- To close the settings or filter menu press `Esc`. Pressing `Enter` or `Space`\n  on a button can also close the menu.\n\n### Best practices\n\n#### Use a set of buttons to apply all changes\n\nIn some use cases when live filtering is not feasible or the preferred method,\nuse a set of buttons to either reset or apply all selected changes in the\nsettings or filter menu. Once the \"Apply\" button has been selected, the menu\ncloses and the results are updated.\n\n#### Don't overcrowd menus with unnecessary content\n\nOnly include content or interactive elements that are necessary. Overcrowding\ndisclosures with too many options or additional content can be distracting to\nthe user.\n\n#### Include enough space between elements\n\nWhen placing interactive elements, be mindful of the padding between the\ninteractive element and other content in the disclosure. A good rule of thumb is\nto keep at least 16px padding between different elements and content.\n\n## Combo button\n\nA combo button is a type of disclosure pattern and displays a primary default\naction that discloses a list of additional, related actions to choose from in a\npopover.\n\n### Anatomy\n\n<Row>\n<Column colLg={8}>\n\n![Anatomy of a combo button.](images/disclosures-combo-button-anatomy.png)\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\n<Caption>Anatomy of a combo button.</Caption>\n\n1. **Primary button:** A default action.\n2. **Icon button:** A trigger to open and close the popover.\n3. **Content area:** A list of additional actions.\n4. **Menu:** Uses the popover component as an underlying layer.\n\n### Structure\n\nA combo button is made up of three parts—a primary button, an icon button, and a\npopover. Dividers are shown to visually separate different actions that are\nrelated to each other.\n\n<Row>\n<Column colLg={8}>\n\n![Example of combo button structure.](images/disclosures-combo-button-structure.png)\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\n### Functionality\n\n#### Mouse\n\nClicking the primary default action will perform the defaulted action. Clicking\nthe icon button triggers the popover to open and reveals the additional actions\nto choose from in a menu. Clicking on an action in the menu will perform the\naction. To close the menu click on the icon button again, or anywhere on the\npage outside of the menu.\n\n<Row>\n<Column colLg={8}>\n\n![Example of combo button functionality.](images/disclosures-combo-button-functionality.png)\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\n#### Keyboard\n\nPrimary default button: `Tab` to the primary default button to apply focus.\nTrigger the primary default button by pressing `Enter` or `Space`.\n\nIcon button: `Tab` to the icon button to apply focus. Open the menu by\npressing `Enter`, `Space`, or the `Down` arrow key.\n\nMenu: When the menu is opened, focus will go to the first additional action in\nthe menu list. Move between menu actions by pressing the `Up` and `Down` arrow\nkeys. Close the menu by pressing `Enter` or  `Space` to activate the action with\nfocus or `Esc` to cancel.\n\n### Best practices\n\n#### Choose a default action\n\nRemember to choose the default, primary action that will be displayed in the\nprimary button so it is not hidden within the menu of additional actions. The\nprimary default action is typically the most commonly used action there is to\ntake.\n\n#### Use to reduce visual complexity on a page\n\nCombo buttons reduce visual complexity by grouping similar commands together.\nFor example, how navigation menus group together related options to enable\nconceptual understanding of the site information structure.\n\n#### Avoid using extra icons\n\nAvoid using extra icons inside of the default, primary button and the additional\nactions in the menu to reduce visual noise between elements. Keep button labels\nclear and concise.\n\n<DoDontRow>\n<DoDont\ntype=\"do\"\ncaption=\"Do have only text in the primary default button.\">\n\n![Do have only text in the primary default button.](./images/disclosures-combo-button-do.png)\n\n</DoDont>\n\n<DoDont\ntype=\"dont\"\ncaption=\"Do not include an icon in the primary default button or next to additional actions.\">\n\n![Do not include an icon in the primary default button or next to additional actions.](./images/disclosures-combo-button-dont.png)\n\n</DoDont>\n</DoDontRow>\n\n## Accessibility\n\n#### Screen readers\n\nVoiceOver: Users can trigger a button to open a disclosure popover by pressing\n`Enter` or `Space` while the trigger has focus.\n\nJAWS: Users can trigger a button to open a disclosure popover by pressing\n`Enter` or `Space` while the trigger has focus.\n\nNVDA: Users can trigger a button to open a disclosure popover by pressing\n`Enter` or `Space` while the trigger has focus.\n\n## Related\n\n#### Button\n\nButtons are clickable interactive elements that are commonly used in disclosures\nas the trigger to open a popover. There are multiple variants of button that\nshould be used for certain use cases. For further guidance, see Carbon's\n[button component](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/components/button/usage/)\nguidance.\n\n#### Popover\n\nPopovers are frequently used in disclosures to show additional content. Popovers\nare also used in components like tooltips, overflow menus, and dropdown menus.\nFor further guidance of how to use a popover, see Carbon’s\n[popover component](https://v11.carbondesignsystem.com/components/popover/usage/).\n\n#### Toggletip\n\nToggletip uses the disclosure pattern to toggle the visibility of a popover. The\npopover may contain a variety of information, from descriptive text to\ninteractive elements. Toggletips are triggered on click to disclose the\ninformation inside of a popover. For further guidance, see Carbon's\n[toggletip component](https://v11.carbondesignsystem.com/components/toggletip/usage/)\nguidance.\n\n## References\n\nContext menu,\n[Delivering Relevant Tools for Tasks](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/contextual-menus/),(Nielsen\nNorman Group)\n\nSplit\nButtons,[Component definition](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/split-buttons/),(Nielsen\nNorman Group)\n\nPopup,[Component research](https://open-ui.org/components/popup.research#popup),(OpenUI)\n\nEnabling\nPopups,[Initial Explainer](https://open-ui.org/components/popup.research.explainer),(OpenUI)\n\nDisclosure,[W3C WAI-ARIA practices](https://v11.carbondesignsystem.com/components/popover/usage/%5Bhttps://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices-1.1/#disclosure),(W3C\nWorking Group Note)\n\n## Feedback\n\nHelp us improve this pattern by providing feedback, asking questions, and\nleaving any other comments on\n[GitHub](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon-website/issues/new?assignees=&labels=feedback&template=feedback.md).\n","type":"Mdx","contentDigest":"78bd2053c1314e91f1427e1194420b17","owner":"gatsby-plugin-mdx","counter":5064},"frontmatter":{"title":"Disclosures","description":"Disclosures are moments that open up on a page and reveal additional information related to the source it is triggered from."},"exports":{},"rawBody":"---\ntitle: Disclosures\ndescription:\n  Disclosures are moments that open up on a page and reveal additional\n  information related to the source it is triggered from.\n---\n\n<PageDescription>\n\nDisclosures are moments that open up on a page and reveal additional information\nrelated to the source it is triggered from.\n\n</PageDescription>\n\n<AnchorLinks>\n\n<AnchorLink>Overview</AnchorLink>\n<AnchorLink>Profile menu</AnchorLink>\n<AnchorLink>Settings and filter menus</AnchorLink>\n<AnchorLink>Combo button</AnchorLink>\n<AnchorLink>Accessibility</AnchorLink>\n<AnchorLink>Related</AnchorLink>\n<AnchorLink>References</AnchorLink>\n<AnchorLink>Feedback</AnchorLink>\n\n</AnchorLinks>\n\n## Overview\n\nDisclosures support a wide range of different use cases in product interfaces\nand are commonly used to reveal more information or details about an element or\ncontent on a page.

The trigger button can visually\nchange its shape and size depending on the usecase.\n\nThe trigger button can use any of our button types and can be set at these three\nsizes—48px (lg), 40px (md) or 32px (sm).\n\n<Row>\n<Column colLg={8}>\n\n![Example of trigger button container height sizes.](images/disclosure-button-container-size.png)\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\n<Caption>Example of trigger button container height sizes.</Caption>\n\n#### Trigger button icon\n\nIf a trigger button contains an icon, the icon size should be either 20px or\n16px.\n\n<Row>\n<Column colLg={8}>\n\n![Example of trigger button icon sizes.](images/disclosure-button-icon-size.png)\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\n<Caption>Example of trigger button icon sizes.</Caption>\n\n#### Popover\n\nA popover component is used as the underlying layer of a disclosure to disclose\nits content. See the\n[popover component](https://v11.carbondesignsystem.com/components/popover/usage/)\nguidance for more information.\n\n<Row>\n<Column colLg={8}>\n\n![Example of a popover container.](images/disclosure-popover.png)\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\n<Caption>Example of a popover container.</Caption>\n\n### Content\n\nThe type of content in a disclosure can vary depending on the use case. A\ndisclosure can be simple and contain solely informational text. In some cases\ncontent can be more complex and include a combination of multiple sections and\ninteractive elements. Below are some common examples and best practices of how\nto show body text, heading text, and footer content in disclosures.\n\n#### Heading text\n\nHeading text can be placed above body text in a disclosure. Placing the heading\ntext with 0px padding above the body text or adding a divider between the\nheading text and body text are two different common use cases.\n\n<Row>\n<Column colLg={8}>\n\n![Example of a disclosure with heading text.](images/disclosure-heading-text.png)\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\n<Caption>Example of a disclosure with heading text.</Caption>\n\n#### Footer content\n\nFooter content can be placed below the body text it is related to. Placing the\nfooter content with 16px padding below the body text or adding a divider between\nthe footer content and body text are two different common use cases.\n\n<Row>\n<Column colLg={8}>\n\n![Example of a disclosure with footer content.](images/disclosure-footer-content.png)\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\n<Caption>Example of a disclosure with footer content.</Caption>\n\n#### Multiple sections of text\n\nDepending on the use case, you may need a disclosure to show multiple sections\nof content. Use padding or dividers to visually create sections. Profile menus\nand context menus typically display multiple sections of content depending on\nthe complexity of the menu.\n\n<Row>\n<Column colLg={8}>\n\n![Example of a disclosure with multiple sections.](images/disclosure-multiple-sections.png)\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\n<Caption>Example of a disclosure with multiple sections.</Caption>\n\n#### Interactive elements\n\nDisclosures allow you to place interactive elements in a popover while still\nkeeping it accessible. Settings and filters often include components like radio\nbuttons and checkboxes that the user can interact with to adjust specific\ncontent. Searching within a menu is another common use case of including\ninteractive elements within a popover.\n\n<Row>\n<Column colLg={8}>\n\n![Example of a disclosure with interactive content.](images/disclosure-interactive-elements.png)\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\n<Caption>Example of a disclosure with interactive content.</Caption>\n\n## Common use cases\n\nDisclosures are used for a wide variety of use cases. The following variants are\na few examples of common disclosures that you may come across frequently in\nproduct interfaces.\n\n| Example                   | Use cases                                                                                                                                                                                                              |\n| ------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| Profile menu              | Profile menus are typically part of a UI shell header and can have navigational options related to a user's account or active session.                                                                                 |\n| Settings and filter menus | Settings and filter menus are frequently used within data table toolbars to enable users to adjust content. Filter and sort menus can also be used for filtering large amounts of content on a page or an entire page. |\n| Combo button              | Combo buttons are used to contain multiple related actions that come with a default, primary action. Additional actions live in the menu.                                                                              |\n\n## Profile menu\n\nProfile menus follow the disclosure pattern by clicking an icon button that\nopens a popover. Profile menus are essential to a product's UI and users rely on\nit to find global content related to their account, product, and active session\ninformation. Profile menus provide a way to log in or out of an account and let\nusers access their settings. Additional links and icons can be added to a\nprofile menu depending on the use case.\n\nSee the\n[profile menu pattern](https://pages.github.ibm.com/cdai-design/pal/patterns/profile-header-menu/)\nfor more information.\n\n### Anatomy\n\n<Row>\n<Column colLg={8}>\n\n![Anatomy of a profile menu.](images/disclosures-profile-menu-anatomy.png)\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\n<Caption>Anatomy of a profile menu.</Caption>\n\n1. **Toolbar profile image:** A profile image, initials, or icon of a user.\n2. **Menu profile image:** A profile image that is paired with high level\n   information about the user, such as a name or handle.\n3. **Section dividers (optional):** To group related content by creating visual\n   sections.\n4. **Contextual information (optional):** Global information that is related to\n   the account or active session.\n5. **Link (optional):** Additional links that are not main menu items. Links can\n   be used for editing, prompting a modal, etc.\n6. **Menu items:** The main and most commonly used menu items that are\n   navigational.\n7. **Icon (optional):** Additional icons to place inline with menu items.\n\n### Structure\n\nA profile menu is made up of two parts—an icon button and a popover. Profile\nmenus support a variety of content that can range in complexity. Some profile\nmenus are simple while other menus may be more complex and require multiple\nsections of information. Profile menus that are complex may benefit from\nincluding interactive elements depending on the use case.\n\n<Row>\n<Column colLg={12}>\n\n![Example of a simple and complex profile menu.](images/disclosures-profile-menu-simple-complex.png)\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\n<Caption>Example of a simple and complex profile menu.</Caption>\n\n### Functionality\n\n#### Mouse\n\nClicking the icon button triggers the profile menu to open and reveals\ninformation related to the users profile and account. The user can then click on\nmenu items and other interactive elements within the menu. To close the menu,\nclick on the icon button trigger again or anywhere on the page out side of the\nmenu.\n\n<Row>\n<Column colLg={8}>\n\n![Example of a closed and opened profile menu.](images/disclosures-profile-menu-structure.png)\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\n#### Keyboard\n\n- `Tab` to the icon button trigger to apply focus.\n- To open the profile menu press `Enter` or `Space`.\n- Once opened, focus goes to the first item in the menu.\n- To navigate the profile menu items press the `Up` and `Down` arrow keys.\n- To select an item in the profile menu press `Enter`.\n- To close the profile menu press `Esc` .\n\n### Best practices\n\n#### Use with a global toolbar header\n\nIf a product has a global toolbar header and offers login capabilities, use the\nprofile menu. Provide a way for the user to log out of an account, make changes\nto profile information, or navigate to settings.\n\n#### Show information that is pertinent to the user account or session\n\nInclude sections on a global contextual level that may be helpful to the user to\nsee in the profile menu. For example, indicating the current plan or location\nwith an option to edit or change the current information can be valuable to\ninclude in a profile menu depending on the use case.\n\n#### Add icons and links to help guide the user\n\nWhen appropriate, pair icons with related menu items or information to indicate\nthe action that will be performed once it is clicked. Provide links next to\nrelated menu items or information to specify there are additional quick actions\nto take, whether it be upgrading an account plan or changing a location. Only\nadd icons and links to a profile menu if completely necessary in order to not\noverwhelm the user and to reduce visual clutter within the menu.\n\n## Settings and filter menus\n\nSettings and filters follow the disclosure pattern by clicking an icon button\nthat opens a popover. Interactive elements are often found in settings and\nfilters in order to modify or adjust specific content. The disclosure pattern\nallows you to nest interactive elements inside of a popover while still being\naccessible.\n\n### Anatomy\n\n<Row>\n<Column colLg={8}>\n\n![Anatomy of a settings menu.](images/disclosures-settings-anatomy.png)\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\n<Caption>Anatomy of a settings menu.</Caption>\n\n1. **Icon button:** A trigger to open and close the popover.\n2. **Popover:** Uses the popover component as an underlying layer.\n3. **Content area:** Area to place text and interactive elements.\n4. **Button group:** To cancel or apply changes in settings or filters that\n   affect other content on the page.\n\n### Structure\n\nSettings or filter menus are made up of two parts—an icon button and a popover.\nThese types of menus usually contain interactive elements. For example, use\nbuttons to clear filters, use checkboxes, radio buttons, or dropdowns to adjust\ncontent and use sets of buttons to reset or apply changes. Content may vary\ndepending on what is being filtered, sorted, or what settings need to be\ndefined.\n\n<Row>\n<Column colLg={8}>\n\n![Example of a filter menu structure.](images/disclosures-settings-structure.png)\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\n<Caption>Example of a filter menu structure</Caption>\n\n### Functionality\n\n#### Mouse\n\nClicking the icon button triggers the popover to open. Upon opening the menu,\nthe first interactive element in the menu receives focus. To close the menu\nclick on the icon button again, or anywhere on the page outside of the menu.\n\n<Row>\n<Column colLg={8}>\n\n![Example of a closed and opened filter menu.](images/disclosures-settings-functionality.png)\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\n<Caption>Example of a closed and opened filter menu.</Caption>\n\n#### Keyboard\n\n- `Tab` to the icon button trigger to apply focus.\n- To open the settings or filter menu press `Enter` or `Space`.\n- Upon opening the menu, the first interactive element in the menu receives\n  focus.\n- To shift focus to different interactive elements in the menu press the `Tab`\n  or `Shift` + `Tab`.\n- To close the settings or filter menu press `Esc`. Pressing `Enter` or `Space`\n  on a button can also close the menu.\n\n### Best practices\n\n#### Use a set of buttons to apply all changes\n\nIn some use cases when live filtering is not feasible or the preferred method,\nuse a set of buttons to either reset or apply all selected changes in the\nsettings or filter menu. Once the \"Apply\" button has been selected, the menu\ncloses and the results are updated.\n\n#### Don't overcrowd menus with unnecessary content\n\nOnly include content or interactive elements that are necessary. Overcrowding\ndisclosures with too many options or additional content can be distracting to\nthe user.\n\n#### Include enough space between elements\n\nWhen placing interactive elements, be mindful of the padding between the\ninteractive element and other content in the disclosure. A good rule of thumb is\nto keep at least 16px padding between different elements and content.\n\n## Combo button\n\nA combo button is a type of disclosure pattern and displays a primary default\naction that discloses a list of additional, related actions to choose from in a\npopover.\n\n### Anatomy\n\n<Row>\n<Column colLg={8}>\n\n![Anatomy of a combo button.](images/disclosures-combo-button-anatomy.png)\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\n<Caption>Anatomy of a combo button.</Caption>\n\n1. **Primary button:** A default action.\n2. **Icon button:** A trigger to open and close the popover.\n3. **Content area:** A list of additional actions.\n4. **Menu:** Uses the popover component as an underlying layer.\n\n### Structure\n\nA combo button is made up of three parts—a primary button, an icon button, and a\npopover. Dividers are shown to visually separate different actions that are\nrelated to each other.\n\n<Row>\n<Column colLg={8}>\n\n![Example of combo button structure.](images/disclosures-combo-button-structure.png)\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\n### Functionality\n\n#### Mouse\n\nClicking the primary default action will perform the defaulted action. Clicking\nthe icon button triggers the popover to open and reveals the additional actions\nto choose from in a menu. Clicking on an action in the menu will perform the\naction. To close the menu click on the icon button again, or anywhere on the\npage outside of the menu.\n\n<Row>\n<Column colLg={8}>\n\n![Example of combo button functionality.](images/disclosures-combo-button-functionality.png)\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\n#### Keyboard\n\nPrimary default button: `Tab` to the primary default button to apply focus.\nTrigger the primary default button by pressing `Enter` or `Space`.\n\nIcon button: `Tab` to the icon button to apply focus. Open the menu by\npressing `Enter`, `Space`, or the `Down` arrow key.\n\nMenu: When the menu is opened, focus will go to the first additional action in\nthe menu list. Move between menu actions by pressing the `Up` and `Down` arrow\nkeys. Close the menu by pressing `Enter` or  `Space` to activate the action with\nfocus or `Esc` to cancel.\n\n### Best practices\n\n#### Choose a default action\n\nRemember to choose the default, primary action that will be displayed in the\nprimary button so it is not hidden within the menu of additional actions. The\nprimary default action is typically the most commonly used action there is to\ntake.\n\n#### Use to reduce visual complexity on a page\n\nCombo buttons reduce visual complexity by grouping similar commands together.\nFor example, how navigation menus group together related options to enable\nconceptual understanding of the site information structure.\n\n#### Avoid using extra icons\n\nAvoid using extra icons inside of the default, primary button and the additional\nactions in the menu to reduce visual noise between elements. Keep button labels\nclear and concise.\n\n<DoDontRow>\n<DoDont\ntype=\"do\"\ncaption=\"Do have only text in the primary default button.\">\n\n![Do have only text in the primary default button.](./images/disclosures-combo-button-do.png)\n\n</DoDont>\n\n<DoDont\ntype=\"dont\"\ncaption=\"Do not include an icon in the primary default button or next to additional actions.\">\n\n![Do not include an icon in the primary default button or next to additional actions.](./images/disclosures-combo-button-dont.png)\n\n</DoDont>\n</DoDontRow>\n\n## Accessibility\n\n#### Screen readers\n\nVoiceOver: Users can trigger a button to open a disclosure popover by pressing\n`Enter` or `Space` while the trigger has focus.\n\nJAWS: Users can trigger a button to open a disclosure popover by pressing\n`Enter` or `Space` while the trigger has focus.\n\nNVDA: Users can trigger a button to open a disclosure popover by pressing\n`Enter` or `Space` while the trigger has focus.\n\n## Related\n\n#### Button\n\nButtons are clickable interactive elements that are commonly used in disclosures\nas the trigger to open a popover. There are multiple variants of button that\nshould be used for certain use cases. For further guidance, see Carbon's\n[button component](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/components/button/usage/)\nguidance.\n\n#### Popover\n\nPopovers are frequently used in disclosures to show additional content. Popovers\nare also used in components like tooltips, overflow menus, and dropdown menus.\nFor further guidance of how to use a popover, see Carbon’s\n[popover component](https://v11.carbondesignsystem.com/components/popover/usage/).\n\n#### Toggletip\n\nToggletip uses the disclosure pattern to toggle the visibility of a popover. The\npopover may contain a variety of information, from descriptive text to\ninteractive elements. Toggletips are triggered on click to disclose the\ninformation inside of a popover.
