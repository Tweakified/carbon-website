While this\neffort was led by the Cloud PAL team, they involved the Cloud community,\nstarting with a Design Jam and a visual design guild.\n\nThe transition was split into four phases that most Cloud services completed at\nthe same time. Because the majority of services switched to Carbon together,\nthere was a smooth, unified user experience with the updates.\n\nUsing patterns created with Carbon 10, IBM Cloud was able to reduce their user\njourneys by seven steps and raise their NPS score by 57%. IBM Cloud has also\nseen increases in operational efficiency for developer and designers now using\nCarbon 10. They have also found in user research that participants prefer the\nnew designs and the average time to provision a service has improved by 4%.\n\n## The challenge\n\nCarbon 10 was released in Q2 2019. The update included major visual and\nstructural changes to align with the revamped IBM Design Language. Part of these\nupdates involved a redesign of existing components and introduced the UI shell\nand the 2x Grid. With hundreds of services, IBM Cloud needed a way to manage the\ntransition from Carbon 9 and Carbon 10 at an organizational level.\n\n## The proposed solution\n\n### Creating a pattern and asset library\n\nIn order to coordinate the transition to Carbon 10, IBM Cloud leveraged their\nPlatform Integration Experiences team to create a Pattern and Asset Library\n(PAL) that was specific to Cloud services. Because they were transitioning so\nmany services, IBM Cloud was able to create a dedicated, cross-functional team\nthat was solely focused on supporting the transition to Carbon 10 and the\ncreation of Cloud-specific assets and resources.\n\nRather than the project being grassroots and trying to convince every single\nteam to participate, the transition started from the top. The IBM Cloud VP of\nDesign, Arin Bhowmick, and Director of Design, Bill Grady, made the case for the\neffort and mandated that Cloud teams participate.\n\nCreating a PAL and getting the hundreds of Cloud services to adopt both Carbon\n10 and Cloud PAL needed a specific dedicated team with a project plan. While the\nCloud PAL team managed the logistics of the transition, they wanted to build a\ncommunity around the effort so they brought the whole organization into the\neffort, starting with a Design Jam.\n\n## The approach\n\n### Kicking off with a Design Jam\n\nIn May 2019 when the effort was just beginning, the Cloud PAL team held a Design\nJam. Designers and developers across all the Cloud services came together for a\nday and worked to create preliminary patterns using the Carbon 10 guidelines.\nThey were split into random groups and given a design pattern to create during\nthe workshop. Because the members of each group all had different roles and came\nfrom different teams, they were able to share and build on different\nperspectives and this led to the teams coming up with pretty solid first draft\npatterns.\n\n<Row>\n<Column colLg={8}>\n\n![Design jam](images/design-jam.jpg)\n\n<Caption>Cloud Design Jam, May 2019.</Caption>\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\n### Establishing a visual design guild\n\nThe patterns that came out of the Design Jam were a great starting place, but\nthey were simple and safe. They lacked the brand identity and excitement that\nthe Cloud PAL team knew was necessary for the effort to be successful.\n\nA Cloud visual design guild came together to create explorations for the Design\nJam patterns to push them further. Each week the guild met with the Carbon team\nto receive feedback and ensure the explorations were aligned with Carbon 10 and\nthe IBM Design Language. When the templates and patterns were locked down, they\nwere the best they could be and had been vetted by the Carbon team, the Brand\nteam, and the Cloud community.\n\n<Row>\n<Column colLg={8}>\n\n![Visual design guild page iterations](images/Voltron.png)\n\n<Caption>Iterations of the catalog page from the visual design guild.</Caption>\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\n### Publishing coded templates and patterns\n\nCloud PAL used the Carbon 10 guidance and components to create templates and\npatterns for Cloud-specific use cases and flows. Cloud PAL published templates\nand resources, primarily based on the design guild deliverables, that were more\nspecific and prescriptive for Cloud than the Carbon guidance. They not only\ndesigned these templates and patterns, but also coded them, so that teams would\nbe implementing the exact same pieces.\n\nThe Cloud patterns included bespoke APIs which meant when teams used a pattern\nor template, they were given all the code with the APIs and parameters baked in\nso that everything worked the same and multiple teams didn't spend time\nimplementing the same APIs over and over.\n\nOver the course of the transition, Cloud PAL designed a total of 22 patterns\nthat cover 90% of Cloud UIs.\n\n### Adoption management\n\n#### The phases\n\nInitially, the Cloud PAL team discussed supporting adoption in groups, so that\nnot every team had to transition over to using Carbon 10 at the same time.\nUltimately, they decided against this because they did not want to have to\nprovide dual maintenance while teams switched over. Instead, they decided to use\na phased approach with four phases that every team had to follow.\n\n1. First, teams migrated to Carbon 10 components and patterns but used a Carbon\n   9 theme so the visual style still matched what they currently had. They also\n   began introducing some Cloud PAL components during this phase.\n2. During the second phase, the Carbon 10 theme was toggled on and all Cloud\n   teams switched from using the Carbon 9 theme to using the Carbon 10 theme.\n   This meant that teams were prepared for the transition and all the Cloud\n   services switched to using the Carbon 10 visual style at the same time.\n3. By phase three, all the services were already using Carbon 10, so this phase\n   focused on the Cloud PAL patterns. During this time, teams were expected to\n   adopt the core Cloud PAL patterns to further unify the services.\n4. Finally, they could focus on continuous delivery. Teams continuously adopted\n   new patterns and components as they were released by the Cloud PAL team.\n\n#### Governance\n\nWith the support of their design executives, a governance model was established.\nDuring each phase, service teams had to go through a review with the Cloud PAL\nteam. These reviews followed well-documented rubrics and ensured that teams were\nmeeting the requirements for each phase.\n\nRequirements on the rubric were each given a priority level of Priority 1,\nPriority 2, or Priority 3. If a team failed a Priority 1 requirement, they could\nnot release the update until the requirement had been addressed. The reviews\ngave the Cloud PAL team insight into how teams were applying the Carbon and\nCloud PAL guidance and gave them an opportunity to address any miscommunications\nor inconsistencies before the services were released.\n\nWhile most of the Cloud services were required to participate in this effort, it\ndid not make sense for every single service to participate. The governance model\nincluded an exemption process for teams that did not think their services should\nadopt Carbon 10 and the Cloud PAL.\n\nThis process, however, was just as involved as adoption itself, so it was not an\neasier route for teams to take. Teams who wanted an exemption needed to get sign\noff from their executives and needed to provide a real justification that\noutlined the client impact. They found that many of the teams applying for an\nexemption really just needed a deferral to push out the timeline. The Cloud PAL\nteam also found that several of the teams asked for exemptions because they did\nnot have development resources for the adoption effort, so they were able to\nprovide extra support to those teams and help with development.\n\n## Positive outcomes\n\n### Success for end users\n\nThe transition resulted in many tangible benefits for the end user.\n\n- IBM Cloud’s NPS score improved by 57% in the first three months after the\n  transition.\n- They reduced seven steps from user journeys and improved the average time to\n  provision a service by 4%.\n- End users were 210% more likely to rate services as “powerful,” “innovative,”\n  and “secure” than before, and 180% less likely to rate them as “elaborate” or\n  “corporate.”\n- In a brand test, 88% of users preferred the new screens.\n- IBM Cloud also saw an 18% reduction in support tickets in areas where teams\n  implemented and followed Carbon 10 and Cloud PAL guidance.\n\n### Widespread adoption\n\nAs of January 2021, 116 of the 155 services have adopted Carbon 10. Twenty-one\nof the remaining services have approved exceptions and will never adopt. The\nremaining services are continuing to work on a plan for adoption.\n\n### Operational efficiency\n\nIBM Cloud estimates their design and development teams saved 2,000 hours per\npattern, making them 80% more efficient than coding or designing screens from\nscratch. Cloud PAL created \"connected components\" that saved teams even more\ntime. They removed hundreds of lines of code from each usage since these\ncomponents had APIs built in, and they created both visual and data consistency\nacross the platform.\n\n## Next steps\n\nCloud PAL is supporting adoption for the few teams that have been delayed. They\nare also focusing on continuously improving and developing new components and\npatterns for their services.\n\n## Resources\n\n<Row className=\"resource-card-group\">\n<Column colLg={4} colMd={4} noGutterSm>\n  <ResourceCard\n    subTitle=\"Cloud Pattern and Asset Library\"\n    href=\"https://pages.github.ibm.com/ibmcloud/pal/\"\n    >\n\n![Cloud icon](images/ibm-cloud.svg)\n\n  </ResourceCard>\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n","type":"Mdx","contentDigest":"12b06dd86da6ca8d87b2a21662592582","owner":"gatsby-plugin-mdx","counter":4715},"frontmatter":{"title":"Consistency in the Cloud","description":"The IBM Cloud team recently took on the challenge to achieve visual and UX consistency across their products by transitioning to Carbon 10.
