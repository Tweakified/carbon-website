They took an iterative approach, starting first with small,\nisolated features to get comfortable designing and developing with Carbon. Next,\nthey replaced existing elements with Carbon components. Once all the components\nhad been transitioned, the team focused on updating page structures and layouts.\n\nSince the Carbon implementation, the team’s delivery cycle has sped up and\nthey spend less time on quality assurance. Their product is now aligned with the\nother IBM.com experiences that use Carbon, creating a consistency of experience.\nTheir conversion rate increased by 5% and more than 50% of customers are\nconverting to purchase, which puts them on par with industry benchmarks.\n\n## The challenge\n\n### Project goals\n\nThe IBM.com Commerce Platform team had a mission — to improve the completion\nrate for their checkout flow. They knew there were usability issues in the\ncheckout process but they also wanted to add new features.\n\nBy aligning their checkout flow with the Carbon Design System, they could add\nnew features in a consistent way and make a lot of small improvements, which\nwould have a large impact on the completion rate and therefore revenue.\n\nThe team aimed to do this by decreasing clicks, increasing device compatibility,\nintroducing high-value features, and fixing existing bugs. An additional goal\nwas to reduce the amount of time IBM support was spending manually identifying\nand resolving order issues.\n\n### Analytics and research\n\nSite analytics helped identify existing issues in the checkout process. There\nwere key issues to address during the transition to Carbon:\n\n- There was a lack of visual and information hierarchy on the page.\n- Critical information was missing when users encountered an error, and this\n  blocked them from moving forward.\n- Customers felt the checkout experience was unreliable, and couldn't quickly\n  find what they wanted, so they abandoned the flow.\n\n### Competitors\n\nThe Commerce team knew their eCommerce marketplace was falling behind\ncompetitors, in both market share and user experience. Competitors had been\nmoving to a more modern experience that used data given by customers to\npre-populate fields, which significantly reduced the number of clicks. The team\nused this project to strategically update their product to be able to better\ncompete in the marketplace.\n\n## The proposed solution\n\n### Transitioning to Carbon\n\nImplementing Carbon would make the interface more clear, meaning users would no\nlonger get lost in the flow and would be able to find what they needed. It would\nalso align key pages before, during, and after the checkout process, creating a\nsense of continuity. The team hypothesized that as a result, users would be less\nlikely to defect.\n\nThe team mapped out their transition to Carbon, focusing at first on a core set\nof pages. While implementing Carbon components and aligning to the IBM Design\nLanguage, they took the opportunity to reevaluate their typography and\nillustrations. By improving their type hierarchy and illustrations they hoped to\ntransform a somewhat dry experience to something delightful, while building more\nconfidence and trust in the interface itself.\n\n<Row>\n<Column colLg={6}>\n\n![Order confirmation page prior to the redesign](images/checkout-before.png)\n\n<Caption>\n  <span class=\"cds--type-semibold\">Before:</span> Order confirmation page prior\n  to the redesign.\n</Caption>\n\n</Column>\n\n<Column colLg={6}>\n\n![Order confirmation page after the redesign](images/checkout-after.png)\n\n<Caption>\n  <span class=\"cds--type-semibold\">After:</span> Order confirmation page after\n  the redesign.\n</Caption>\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\n### Identifying high value features\n\nThe second part of the solution was identifying high impact features they could\nimplement in tandem with the Carbon transition. Many of these features were\nself-contained and so they paired well with the overall transition to Carbon, as\nthe team learned to design and develop with the design system.\n\nThe global address form was one of these features. The new form validated\naddresses as users entered them, giving users confidence that they’d input the\ncorrect address. Additionally, the support team no longer had to manually follow\nup on invalid addresses, making the experience better for everyone.\n\n## The approach\n\nThe transition to Carbon was an iterative process. Rather than updating the\nentire interface at one time, the Commerce Platform team transitioned their\nproduct slowly and tactically. By adopting Carbon iteratively, they were able to\nsee which changes made substantial impacts and use that to inform their roadmap\nand subsequent changes.\n\n### Learning the design system\n\nBefore jumping into adopting Carbon, it was important to spend time learning\nabout and getting comfortable with Carbon. Shixie Shi Trofimov, the design lead\nof the transition project, led the developers through a crash course to align on\ndefinitions and terminology. She wanted designers and developers to speak the\nsame language as they worked through a set of design specifications.\n\n<Row>\n<Column colLg={8}>\n\n![Carbon token quiz](images/token-quiz.png)\n\n<Caption>\n  A Carbon token quiz helped get developers comfortable with Carbon token naming\n  conventions.\n</Caption>\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\n### Starting small\n\nThe adoption process started with one modal. Instead of redesigning an existing\nfeature, they identified a high value, self-contained, new feature to develop\nfrom scratch. The modal solved an important usability issue by allowing users to\nchange their country during checkout, but it also provided the developers a\nsimple and non-disruptive entry point into adopting Carbon. It also meant they\ndidn’t have to worry about breaking existing functionality in production and had\na safe place to experiment and ship.\n\nThe process of designing to shipping the modal with Carbon took about a month\nbecause it was the team’s first experience with using Carbon and they were\ngetting up to speed.\n\n<Row>\n<Column colLg={8}>\n\n![New modal using Carbon](images/carbon-modal.png)\n\n<Caption>New modal for switching countries</Caption>\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\n### Mixing new with old\n\nThe first new Carbon modal was placed on an existing page. It was an easy way\nfor the team to get started and begin shipping new pieces. Mixing new with old\nwasn’t disruptive for users. Because the changes were implemented in small\npasses, users may not have even noticed that the experience had changed and\nreturning users did not have to relearn the interface. Also, mixing the\nexperiences meant that got the team to their final result faster.\n\n<Video vimeoId=\"488148768\" />\n<Caption>New modal sitting on the original page</Caption>\n\n### Iterating, iterating, iterating\n\nRather than updating all of the pages at once, the team took an iterative\napproach. By starting with fresh features that integrated with the old\ninterface, the team could ship pieces iteratively.\n\nThe first stage involved switching individual components to their Carbon\nversion, starting with input fields then buttons. After transitioning the\nindividual components, the page structure and layout was updated.\n\nWith this approach, the Commerce team was able to refresh their product’s\nexperience, set the stage for larger future changes, and complete the project in\nonly three months.\n\n<Row>\n<Column colLg={12}>\n\n![Checkout screen in January 2020, April 2020, and the future design](images/iterate.png)\n\n<Caption>\n  From left to right: The checkout screen in January 2020 before the transition,\n  in April 2020 after the transition, and the future design.\n</Caption>\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\n## Benefits\n\nThere have been several benefits from the transition to Carbon for both the\nCommerce team's own workflow and process, and the user experience. The team\nespecially found value in the impact of their delivery speed and need for\nquality assurance.\n\n### Faster delivery\n\nThe entire process for implementing Carbon took only three months and since the\ntransition, the team’s development cycle has sped up. By using Carbon, the\ndevelopers are placing pre-built components and can therefore focus on more\nimportant issues instead of taking the time to build out each element and\ncomponent.\n\n### Minimal quality assurance testing\n\nOnce the team had been fully onboarded to Carbon, delivery required only minimal\nquality assurance testing because they were using components straight out of the\nbox.\n\n<Row>\n<Column colLg={6}>\n\n![Order confirmation page design](images/delivery.png)\n\n<Caption>\n  <span class=\"cds--type-semibold\">Before:</span> The order confirmation screen\n  design that was handed off to developers.\n</Caption>\n\n</Column>\n\n<Column colLg={6}>\n\n![Order confirmation page in production](images/in-prod.png)\n\n<Caption>\n  <span class=\"cds--type-semibold\">After:</span> The order confirmation screen\n  in production at the end of the sprint.\n</Caption>\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\n### Continuity in user experience\n\nThe project vastly improved the continuity in user experience with other IBM\ntouchpoints, including Support and My IBM. These experiences now feel continuous\nand intuitive for users.\n\nWithin the Commerce Platform flow, pages are also unified and organized in the\nsame way, providing familiarity and a feeling of dependability.\n\n<Row>\n<Column colLg={8}>\n\n![Product configuration page](images/continuity-1.png)\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\n<Row>\n<Column colLg={8}>\n\n![Checkout page](images/continuity-2.png)\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\n<Row>\n<Column colLg={8}>\n\n![Order confirmation page](images/continuity-3.png)\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\n<Row>\n<Column colLg={8}>\n\n![Profile page](images/continuity-4.png)\n\n<Caption>\n  From top to bottom: Product configuration, Checkout, Confirmation, and\n  Profile.
