What do I do?\n\n- The 5th step assumes your spaces are in the US South region. To successfully\n  deploy, you might need to update the region code (e.g.\n  `api.[REGION].cf.cloud.ibm.com`) to the region where your spaces were created,\n  or create a space in the US South region.\n\n- If you don't have an org, create one\n  [here](https://cloud.ibm.com/account/cloud-foundry).\n  - In the top nav go to Manage > Account > Account resources > Cloud Foundry\n    orgs\n  - The name you give it doesn't matter, just take note of the region you\n    select, and use that region's API endpoint (e.g.\n    `api.[REGION].cf.cloud.ibm.com`)\n  - Find regions and endpoints\n    [here](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/cloud-foundry-public?topic=cloud-foundry-public-endpoints).\n\n### I am getting an error that says <span className='tutorial-faq-header-code'>`yarn lockfile missing`</span>. How do I fix this?\n\n- This error can occur when the `yarn.lock` file is either missing or differs\n  from the one used in the tutorial step. To fix this, you can go to the Github\n  branch for the step you are on, find the `yarn.lock` file, and copy that file\n  into your working directory. You may need to delete your `node_modules` folder\n  and run `yarn` afterwards.\n\n### I am getting a <span className='tutorial-faq-header-code'>`yarn offline cache`</span> error. How do I fix this?\n\n- Try running\n  `rm -rf .yarn-offline-mirror node_modules && yarn cache clean && yarn install`\n  and push up any changes. If this still does not work, ensure your `yarn.lock`\n  file matches the one at the start of the tutorial step\n\n### When will my PR be reviewed?\n\n- If your PR is passing, it will automatically get approved and closed by a bot.\n  After it's closed, you can move on to the next step.\n\n- If your PR is failing, try out the troubleshooting tips on this page first to\n  fix it. If it's still failing, reach out for help in our slack channel\n  `#carbon-react` or tag `@carbon-design-system/developers` in a comment on your\n  PR for help.\n\n### How can I show others my completion status?\n\n- Proof of your completion of the tutorial can be seen by filtering the PR list\n  to show your five PRs with the `status: approved` label.\n\n- You can filter the pull request list to show only pull requests authored by\n  your username. Replace `YOURUSERNAMEHERE` with your username in the following\n  link:\n\n  - https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon-tutorial/pulls?q=author%3AYOURUSERNAMEHERE\n\n### Other troubleshooting tips\n\n- We updated the `react-scripts` dependency to `v5.0.1`. Pull from `upstream`\n  and run `yarn` or `npm install` to update your remote branch.\n- You no longer need the `.env` with the updated `react-scripts` dependency. If\n  you are up to date, you can delete that file (previously at the root level).\n- Run `yarn format` and commit any changes made.\n","type":"Mdx","contentDigest":"16a88e0a0b19bd396c4336173245bb3e","owner":"gatsby-plugin-mdx","counter":4755},"frontmatter":{"title":"FAQs","description":"Welcome to Carbon!
