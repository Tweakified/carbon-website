This helps the user to know where\nthey are in relation to where they have been, and what sections are to follow.\nClear labels should accompany the progress indicator to indicate what the user\nwill accomplish within each step. Keep labels between one to two words.\n\n#### Validation\n\nUse validation to confirm that a previous step has been completed.
