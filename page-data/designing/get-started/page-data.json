You may also\naccess tools we no longer support, Sketch, Adobe XD, and Axure, by heading to\nthe [Design Toolbox](https://w3.ibm.com/design/toolbox/). However, we no longer\nmaintain or update the kits for these tools.

These kits\ninclude all the Carbon core components and styles for reuse in your product and\nweb experiences. By using the kits you will automatically receive updates made\nto the Carbon libraries, ensuring your designs stay up-to-date with the latest\nreleases. This allows you to speak the same language and have shared\nfunctionality expectations as your developers in the hand-off and development\ncycle.\n\nHead on over to the [Design kits](/designing/kits/figma) section and follow the\ninstructions to get set up with Figma.\n\n### Core design kits\n\nEveryone using Carbon should use the following Figma core design kits as a\nstarting point for building user interfaces. This brings consistency and speed,\nallowing teams to focus on solving more specific user tasks.
