Icons are supported in vanilla, React, Angular, and Vue.\n\n</PageDescription>\n\n<AnchorLinks>\n\n<AnchorLink>Get started</AnchorLink>\n<AnchorLink>Usage</AnchorLink>\n<AnchorLink>Resources</AnchorLink>\n\n</AnchorLinks>\n\n## Get started\n\nTo install `@carbon/icons-react` in your project, you will need to run the\nfollowing command using [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/):\n\n```bash\nnpm install -S @carbon/icons-react\n```\n\nIf you prefer [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/), use the following command\ninstead:\n\n```bash\nyarn add @carbon/icons-react\n```\n\n## Usage\n\nIcons in this package can be accessed through importing them by name.\n\n```jsx\nimport { Add } from '@carbon/icons-react';\n```\n\nIcons in this package support the following sizes: `16`, `20`, `24`, and `32`\npixels. These sizes refer to the width and height of the icon. Icons default to\nsize `16`. You can change the size of the icon by adding the `size` prop:\n\n```js\n<Add size=\"24\" />\n```\n\n_Note: if you would like to find the import path for an icon, you can reference\nour [Icon Library](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/guidelines/icons/library)_\n\n### Icon fill\n\nAll icons from the library support being styled by the `fill` property. You can\nchange the color of an icon by passing in a custom class name that sets this\nproperty (preferred), or by passing in an inline style. For example:\n\n```css\n// CSS custom class name to set the fill of the icon to `rebeccapurple`\nsvg.my-custom-class {\n  fill: rebeccapurple;\n}\n```\n\n```jsx\nimport { Add } from '@carbon/icons-react';\n\nfunction MyComponent() {\n  return (\n    <button>\n      <Add aria-label=\"Add\" className=\"my-custom-class\" />\n    </button>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n#### Two-tone icons\n\nCertain icons in the library support two distinct fill colors. You can target\nthe inner path by using the `[data-icon-path=\"inner-path\"]` attribute selector.\nFor example:\n\n```scss\n// CSS custom class name to set the fill of the icon to `yellow`\nsvg.outer-icon-fill {\n  fill: yellow;\n}\n\n// Use the `data-icon-path` attribute selector to target the inner path\n// where we want to set the fill to `black`. We also set `opacity` to `1` so\n// that this inner-path is visible.\nsvg.outer-icon-fill [data-icon-path='inner-path'] {\n  fill: black;\n  opacity: 1;\n}\n```\n\n```jsx\nimport { WarningFilled } from '@carbon/icons-react';\n\nfunction MyComponent() {\n  return <WarningFilled aria-label=\"Add\" className=\"my-custom-class\" />;\n}\n```\n\n### Focus and `aria-label`\n\nBy default, the icon components from `@carbon/icons-react` are treated as\ndecorative content. This means that we set `aria-hidden=\"true\"` unless certain\nprops are passed to the component.\n\nIf you would like the icon to be announced by a screen reader, you can supply an\n`aria-label` or `aria-labelledby`. For example:\n\n```jsx\nimport { Add } from '@carbon/icons-react';\n\nfunction MyComponent() {\n  return (\n    <button>\n      <Add aria-label=\"Add\" />\n    </button>\n  );\n}\n```\n\nDoing this will add the appropriate `role` to the `<svg>` node, as well.\n\nIf you would like the `<svg>` to receive focus, you will need to pass in a\n`tabIndex` value. For example:\n\n```jsx\nimport { Add } from '@carbon/icons-react';\n\nfunction MyComponent() {\n  return <Add aria-label=\"Add\" tabIndex=\"0\" />;\n}\n```\n\nIncluding `tabIndex` and `aria-label` (or `aria-labelledby`) will set the\ncorresponding `tabindex` on the underlying `<svg>` and verify support in older\nbrowsers like Internet Explorer 11 by setting `focusable` to `true`.\n\n## Resources\n\n<Row className=\"resource-card-group\">\n  <Column colMd={4} colLg={4} noGutterSm>\n    <ResourceCard\n      subTitle=\"Carbon icons package\"\n      href=\"https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon/blob/v10/packages/icons\"\n    >\n\n<MdxIcon name=\"bee\" />\n\n  </ResourceCard>\n  </Column>\n  <Column colMd={4} colLg={4} noGutterSm>\n    <ResourceCard\n      subTitle=\"Icon package demo\"\n      href=\"https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon/blob/v10/packages/icons\"\n    >\n\n<MdxIcon name=\"bee\" />\n\n  </ResourceCard>\n  </Column>\n</Row>\n","type":"Mdx","contentDigest":"769df0072a2e9317a6d220e7a06dc2c8","owner":"gatsby-plugin-mdx","counter":4988},"frontmatter":{"label":"Icons are visual symbols used to represent ideas, objects, or actions.
