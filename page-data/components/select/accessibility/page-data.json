Carbon also incorporates other\naccessibility considerations, some of which are described below.\n\n### Keyboard interaction\n\nA select component is reached by `Tab` and opened with `Space`, or the `Up` or\n`Down` arrow keys. The currently selected option will have focus. The arrow keys\nare also used for navigating between options. Users can jump about in the list\nby pressing individual letter keys, which will reposition to the first option\nbeginning with that letter. Options are selected with `Space` or `Enter` keys,\nwhich also close the select. Pressing `Esc` closes a select without changing the\nselected option.\n\n<Row>\n<Column colLg={8}>\n\n![example of select keyboard interaction](images/select-accessibility-1.png)\n\n<Caption>\n  Selects are reached by Tab.
