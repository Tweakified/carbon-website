Any issue that the Carbon team accepts, but can not fit in their\nroadmap, is open for community contribution.\n\n#### Volunteer for existing work\n\nThe best way to volunteer is to look through\n[existing GitHub issues](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22needs%3A+community+contribution%22+)\nlabeled with `needs: community contribution`. Any issue labeled with\n`needs: design contribution` is fair game! Put a comment in the issue saying\nyou'd like to help.\n\n<Video\n  src=\"/videos/design-contribution.mp4\"\n  poster=\"/videos/design-contribution.png\"\n>\n  <track default srcLang=\"en\" title=\"Volunteer for existing work\" />\n</Video>\n\nThe most common design requests are related to feature enhancements: researching\nUX, creating visual solutions, and crafting a design spec are often required\nbefore a feature enhancement can be put into code.\n\nIf you want to join an issue that is already assigned to someone or has a\nspecific milestone, please discuss with the assignee of the issue or with the\nCarbon team to coordinate. Often contributors work in groups of 2-3.\n\nWe also have many ongoing projects to create and update reusable components in\nFigma. This work is not currently tracked in GitHub, so check out the\n[status of design kits](https://www.figma.com/file/CFMtqV5Nztdbm0mi2UiDLg/Library-%2B-Template-Planning?type=design&node-id=3713-26762&mode=design&t=HqvAYXUeccKNMstT-0)\nand get involved by reaching out to the contacts listed.\n\nThe Carbon team is also happy to help you. Just stop by our\n[Carbon Design office hours](/whats-happening/meetups/) or\n[contact us](/help/contact-us/) directly.\n\n#### Submit an idea\n\nHave a new idea that you think would benefit Carbon? Or do you need to report a\nbug? First, be sure to look through the\n[issue backlog](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon/issues) to make\nsure it is a novel idea or bug. Then, file your proposal on GitHub using the\n[issue templates](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon/issues/new/choose).\nIf you're willing to work on this idea yourself, be sure to let us know in your\nissue! Your idea will then go through a triage process by the Carbon team.\n\n## Step 2: Refine the issue\n\nWhereas code contributions tend to be well defined, design contributions can be\na little more ambiguous. We recommend you try writing a rough task list of what\nyou believe your contribution will entail, and post it in the GitHub issue\ncomments. In most cases, we recommend you then reach out to the Carbon team or\ncome to Carbon Design office hours. We'll help you further refine your issue,\nclarify the scope of work, and connect you to other collaborators. Some good\nquestions to ask yourself are:\n\n- Am I clear on the scope of this work?\n- Is this task list feasible for me to do?\n- Do I need to collaborate with anyone else?\n- Do I have a clear definition of done or a plan to pass this to a developer?\n\n## Step 3: Get feedback\n\nMost contributors work in groups of 2-3 and either set up weekly sessions or\njoin [meetups](/whats-happening/meetups/#carbon-office-hours) such as the Data\nViz Guild or Carbon Design office hours. In these sessions, it is common to\nshare work in progress and ask lots of questions. In return, you'll get candid\nfeedback and help. As you make progress, update your GitHub issue.\n","type":"Mdx","contentDigest":"6a19978ed0114c77d33a76447641822d","owner":"gatsby-plugin-mdx","counter":4998},"frontmatter":{"title":"Design","description":"Design contributions can involve anything from creating design specs for feature requests to maintaining Figma libraries.
