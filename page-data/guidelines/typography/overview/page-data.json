Type tokens\nare pre-set configurations of typographic elements such as font size, weight, or\nleading (line height) that are specifically calibrated for use alongside\n[IBM Plex](http://ibm.com/plex) in product. Selecting the appropriate type style\nis determined by layout or template structure. Layouts may have several levels\nof architecture or areas that require varying typographic hierarchies.\n\n### Productive and expressive type sets\n\nThe productive type set is primarily used within product spaces, where users\nbenefit from a more condensed treatment of content to maintain focus on tasks.\nThe productive styles work together to support the hierarchy of information and\nset user expectations. On the other hand, the larger expressive type styles\nallow for a more dramatic, graphic use of type in editorial and marketing\ndesign. These type styles are excellent for long form reading and scanning, but\nwould be distracting if used in product.\n\nWithin **Body styles** and **Utility styles**, the same set of styles are\noffered. Productive styles are named with a suffix of `-01` and expressive style\nnames have a suffix of `-02`.\n\nThere are two heading sets and the major difference between them is in how they\nare implemented in code. The productive type set uses fixed headings. Expressive\nheadings are responsive and the type styles change size at different\nbreakpoints.\n\nFor more detail, see\n[Style strategies](/guidelines/typography/style-strategies/) and\n[Type sets](/guidelines/typography/type-sets/).\n\n## Typeface: IBM Plex\n\nCarbon uses the open-source typeface **IBM Plex**. It has been carefully\ndesigned to meet IBM's needs as a global technology company and reflect IBM's\nspirit, beliefs, and design principles. IBM Plex can be accessed and downloaded\nfrom the [Plex GitHub Repo](https://github.com/ibm/plex).\n\n<TypeWeight type=\"types\" />\n\n### Sans-serif font stack\n\n```scss\nfont-family: 'IBM Plex Sans', 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, sans-serif;\n```\n\n### Serif font stack\n\n```scss\nfont-family: 'IBM Plex Serif', 'Georgia', Times, serif;\n```\n\n### Mono font stack\n\n```scss\nfont-family: 'IBM Plex Mono', 'Menlo', 'DejaVu Sans Mono',\n  'Bitstream Vera Sans Mono', Courier, monospace;\n```\n\n## Scale\n\nThe IBM type scale is built on a single equation. The formula for our scale was\ncreated to provide hierarchy for all types of experiences. The formula assumes\nthat y₀=12 px.\n\n<br />\n\n<TypeScaleTable />\n\n```\nXn = Xn-1 + {INT[(n-2)/4] + 1} * 2\nXn: step n type size Xn-1: step n-1 type size\n```\n\n## Style\n\nTypography creates purposeful texture, guiding users to read and understand the\nhierarchy of information. The right typographic treatment and the controlled\nusage of type styles helps manage the display of content, keeping it useful,\nsimple, and effective.\n\n### Weights\n\nFont weight is an important typographic variable that can add emphasis and\ndifferentiate content hierarchy. Font weight and size pairings must be carefully\nbalanced. A bold weight will always have more emphasis than a lighter weight\nfont of the same size. However, a lighter weight font can rank hierarchically\nhigher than a bold font if the lighter weight type size is significantly larger\nthan the bold one.\n\nWe suggest using IBM Plex Light, Regular, and SemiBold for digital experiences.\nThe semibold weight is ideal for section headers, but should not be used for\nlong text.\n\n<TypeWeight />\n\n### Italic\n\nEach weight has an italic style, which should only be used when you need to\nemphasize certain words in a sentence (i.e., titles of works, technical terms,\nnames of devices, and captions).\n\n<TypeWeight type=\"italic\" />\n\n## Type color\n\nType color should be carefully considered, with legibility and accessibility as\nparamount concerns. Keep type color neutral in running text. Use primary blue\nfor primary actions.\n\n<DoDontRow>\n<DoDont type=\"do\">\n\n![Neutral color for text](images/Typography_overview_Type-color-1.svg)\n\n</DoDont>\n<DoDont type=\"dont\">\n\n![I'm a magenta sentence for no reason](images/Typography_overview_Type-color-2.svg)\n\n</DoDont>\n</DoDontRow>\n\n<DoDontRow>\n<DoDont type=\"do\" color=\"dark\">\n\n![Neutral color for text](images/Typography_overview_Type-color-3.svg)\n\n</DoDont>\n<DoDont type=\"dont\" color=\"dark\">\n\n![Color is not for decoration](images/Typography_overview_Type-color-4.svg)\n\n</DoDont>\n</DoDontRow>\n\n<DoDontRow>\n<DoDont type=\"do\" caption=\"Core blue colors are used for text links and primary actions\">\n\n![Link with icon](images/Typography_overview_Type-color-5.svg)\n\n</DoDont>\n<DoDont type=\"do\" caption=\"Secondary actions use Gray 100 and icons\">\n\n![Download with icon](images/Typography_overview_Type-color-6.svg)\n\n</DoDont>\n</DoDontRow>\n\n<DoDontRow>\n<DoDont type=\"do\" caption=\"Other use cases for colored type are code snippets, warnings, alerts, etc.\">\n\n![Oops, something went wrong! colored text](images/Typography_overview_Type-color-7.svg)\n\n</DoDont>\n<DoDont type=\"do\">\n\n![Code snippet with colored highlight type](images/Typography_overview_Type-color-8.svg)\n\n</DoDont>\n</DoDontRow>\n\n## Resources\n\n<Row className=\"resource-card-group\">\n<Column colMd={4} colLg={4} noGutterSm>\n  <ResourceCard\n    subTitle=\"Get the latest IBM Plex™ download on GitHub\"\n    href=\"https://github.com/ibm/plex/releases/latest\"\n    >\n\n<MdxIcon name=\"github\" />\n\n  </ResourceCard>\n</Column>\n<Column colMd={4} colLg={4}  noGutterSm>\n  <ResourceCard\n    subTitle=\"Visit the IBM Plex™ website to learn more\"\n    href=\"https://www.ibm.com/plex/\"\n    >\n\n  </ResourceCard>\n</Column>\n<Column colMd={4} colLg={4} noGutterSm>\n  <ResourceCard\n    subTitle=\"Elements package: Type\"\n    href=\"https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon/tree/v10/packages/type\"\n    >\n\n<MdxIcon name=\"github\" />\n\n  </ResourceCard>\n</Column>\n<Column colMd={4} colLg={4}  noGutterSm>\n  <ResourceCard\n    subTitle=\"Type package preview\"\n    href=\"https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon/tree/v10/packages/type\"\n    >\n\n<MdxIcon name=\"codesandbox\" />\n\n </ResourceCard>\n</Column>\n</Row>\n","type":"Mdx","contentDigest":"33703d36447bac5c9206fade6572235b","owner":"gatsby-plugin-mdx","counter":4834},"frontmatter":{"label":"Our approach to the typographic system uses IBM Plex as its typeface.
