So far, we've only used Carbon components to build out two\npages.\n\nNext, we're going to use Carbon assets to build application-specific components.\nWe'll do so by including accessibility and responsive considerations all\nthroughout.\n\nA\n[preview](https://carbon-tutorial-nextjs-9hg9rmepp-carbon-design-system.vercel.app/)\nof what you'll build (see bottom of page):\n\n<Preview\n  height=\"400\"\n  title=\"Carbon Next Tutorial Step 4\"\n  src=\"https://carbon-tutorial-nextjs-9hg9rmepp-carbon-design-system.vercel.app/\"\n  frameborder=\"no\"\n  allowtransparency=\"true\"\n  allowfullscreen=\"true\"\n/>\n\n## Fork, clone and branch\n\nThis tutorial has an accompanying GitHub repository called\n[carbon-tutorial-nextjs](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon-tutorial-nextjs)\nthat we'll use as a starting point for each step. If you haven't forked and\ncloned that repository yet, and haven't added the upstream remote, go ahead and\ndo so by following the\n[step 1 instructions](/developing/react-tutorial/step-1#fork-clone-and-branch).\n\n### Branch\n\nWith your repository all set up, let's check out the branch for this tutorial\nstep's starting point.\n\n```bash\ngit fetch upstream\ngit checkout -b v11-next-step-4 upstream/v11-next-step-4\n```\n\n<InlineNotification>\n\n**Note:** This builds on top of step 3, but be sure to check out the upstream\nstep 4 branch because it includes the static assets required to get through this\nstep.\n\n</InlineNotification>\n\n### Build and start app\n\nInstall the app's dependencies (in case you're starting fresh in your current\ndirectory and not continuing from the previous step):\n\n```bash\nyarn\n```\n\nThen, start the app:\n\n```bash\nyarn dev\n```\n\nYou should see something similar to where the\n[previous step](/developing/react-tutorial/step-3) left off.\n\n## Review design\n\nHere's what we're building – an informational section that has a heading and\nthree subheadings. Each subheading has accompanying copy and a pictogram. We'll\nassume that this informational section is used elsewhere on the site, meaning\nit's a great opportunity to build it as a reusable component. As for naming,\nwe'll call it an `InfoSection` with three `InfoCard`s as children.\n\n![Info section layout](../shared/step-4/images/info-layout.png)\n\n<Caption>Info section layout</Caption>\n\n## Create components\n\nFirst we need files for the components, so create an `Info` folder in\n`src/components`. Even though we're building multiple components, their names\nall start with `Info`, so it makes sense to have them share one folder in\ncomponents. Create these files:\n\n### Add files\n\n```bash\nsrc/components/Info\n├──_info.scss\n└──Info.js\n```\n\nImport `_info.scss` in `app.scss` after all of the `tutorial-header.scss`\nimport.\n\n```scss path=src/app/globals.scss\n@use '@/components/Info/info';\n```\n\n### InfoSection component\n\nLet's create the parent component that includes the \"The Principles\" heading.\nThat markup currently looks like this in `LandingPage`:\n\n```jsx path=src/app/home/page.js\n<Column lg={16} md={8} sm={4} className=\"landing-page__r3\">\n  <Grid>\n    <Column lg={4} md={4} sm={4}>\n      <h3 className=\"landing-page__label\">The Principles</h3>\n    </Column>\n    <Column lg={4} md={4} sm={4}>\n      Carbon is Open\n    </Column>\n    <Column lg={4} md={4} sm={4}>\n      Carbon is Modular\n    </Column>\n    <Column lg={4} md={4} sm={4}>\n      Carbon is Consistent\n    </Column>\n  </Grid>\n</Column>\n```\n\nWe want to do a few things when abstracting it to a component. First, we only\nwant this component's class names; we don't want to include `landing-page__r3`\nas that's specific to the landing page. For that we'll use React `props` so we\ncan pass in and use `props.className`.\n\nWe'll also:\n\n- Add component class names like `info-section`, `info-card`, and\n  `info-section__heading`\n- We will be using the `Grid` and `Column` components\n- Replace `The Principles` with `{props.heading}`\n- Replace columns 2 - 4 with `{props.children}`\n\nUsing `props` we can render any heading and any number of children components\n(`InfoCard` that we'll build soon.)\n\n```javascript path=src/components/Info/Info.js\nimport { Grid, Column } from '@carbon/react';\n\nconst InfoSection = (props) => (\n  <Grid className={`${props.className} info-section`}>\n    <Column md={8} lg={4} xlg={3}>\n      <h3 className=\"info-section__heading\">{props.heading}</h3>\n    </Column>\n    {props.children}\n  </Grid>\n);\n```\n\nAt this point let's import our needed styles and add styling for the new class\nnames that we just added.\n\n```scss path=src/components/Info/_info.scss\n@use '@carbon/react/scss/type' as *;\n\n.info-section__heading {\n  @include type-style('heading-01');\n}\n```\n\n### InfoCard component\n\nNext up we're going to build a component for columns 2 - 4, which currently\nlooks like `<Column md={4} lg={4}>Carbon is Open</Column>`. At the bottom of\n`Info.js`, add:\n\n```javascript path=src/components/Info/Info.js\nconst InfoCard = (props) => {\n  return (\n    <Column sm={4} md={8} lg={4} className=\"info-card\">\n      <h4 className=\"info-card__heading\">{props.heading}</h4>\n      <p className=\"info-card__body\">{props.body}</p>\n      {props.icon()}\n    </Column>\n  );\n};\n\nexport { InfoSection, InfoCard };\n```\n\n<InlineNotification>\n\n**Note:** Make sure to export the two components!\n\n</InlineNotification>\n\nIn doing so, we:\n\n- Added `info-card` classes\n- Used `props` to render the heading, body copy, and icon\n- Set columns to match the grid\n\n## Use components\n\nNothing is styled yet, but with our components built let's put them to use. In\n`LandingPage`, import the components towards the top of the file.\n\n```javascript path=src/app/home/page.js\nimport { InfoSection, InfoCard } from '@/components/Info/Info';\n```\n\nNext, we will install the pictograms we will use in the header.\n\n```bash\nyarn add @carbon/pictograms-react\n```\n\nWhile we're at the top of `LandingPage`, import the pictograms that we'll need\nas well.\n\n```javascript path=src/app/home/page.js\nimport {\n  Advocate,\n  Globe,\n  AcceleratingTransformation,\n} from '@carbon/pictograms-react';\n```\n\nWith everything imported, replace the current:\n\n```jsx path=src/app/home/page.js\n<Grid>\n  <Column md={4} lg={4}>\n    <h3 className=\"landing-page__label\">The Principles</h3>\n  </Column>\n  <Column md={4} lg={4}>\n    Carbon is Open\n  </Column>\n  <Column md={4} lg={4}>\n    Carbon is Modular\n  </Column>\n  <Column md={4} lg={4}>\n    Carbon is Consistent\n  </Column>\n</Grid>\n```\n\nWith the new components:\n\n```javascript path=src/app/home/page.js\n<InfoSection heading=\"The Principles\" className=\"landing-page__r3\">\n  <InfoCard\n    heading=\"Carbon is Open\"\n    body=\"It's a distributed effort, guided by the principles of the open-source movement. Carbon's users are also it's makers, and everyone is encouraged to contribute.\"\n    icon={() => <Advocate size={32} />}\n  />\n  <InfoCard\n    heading=\"Carbon is Modular\"\n    body=\"Carbon's modularity ensures maximum flexibility in execution. It's components are designed to work seamlessly with each other, in whichever combination suits the needs of the user.\"\n    icon={() => <AcceleratingTransformation size={32} />}\n  />\n  <InfoCard\n    heading=\"Carbon is Consistent\"\n    body=\"Based on the comprehensive IBM Design Language, every element and component of Carbon was designed from the ground up to work elegantly together to ensure consistent, cohesive user experiences.\"\n    icon={() => <Globe size={32} />}\n  />\n</InfoSection>\n```\n\n<InlineNotification>\n\n**Note:** Now is a good time to resize your browser from phone to large viewport\nwidths to see how the responsive grid is working before we add further styling.\n\n</InlineNotification>\n\n## Add styling\n\nHere's our design showing the spacing tokens that we need to add. We also need\nto set type style and borders.\n\n![Info section spacing](../shared/step-4/images/info-spacing.png)\n\n### Layout\n\nStarting with layout, import the following carbon styles to\n`src/components/Info/_info.scss`. Make sure to import the needed carbon styles.\n\n```scss path=src/components/Info/_info.scss\n@use '@carbon/react/scss/spacing' as *;\n@use '@carbon/react/scss/breakpoint' as *;\n@use '@carbon/react/scss/theme' as *;\n```\n\nWe will then add the following styles to the same file to style our info cards.\n\n```scss path=src/components/Info/_info.scss\n.info-card {\n  margin-top: $spacing-09;\n  display: flex;\n  flex-direction: column;\n  padding-left: 1rem;\n\n  svg {\n    margin-top: $spacing-09;\n  }\n\n  // top border in only small breakpoints to prevent overrides\n  @include breakpoint-down(md) {\n    &:not(:nth-child(2)) {\n      border-top: 1px solid $border-subtle-01;\n      padding-top: $spacing-09;\n    }\n  }\n\n  // left border in just the 2nd column items\n  @include breakpoint(md) {\n    &:nth-child(odd) {\n      border-left: 1px solid $border-subtle-01;\n    }\n  }\n\n  // left border in all items\n  @include breakpoint(lg) {\n    margin-top: 0;\n    border-left: 1px solid $border-subtle-01;\n\n    svg {\n      margin-top: $spacing-12;\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nOnce you save, go ahead and resize your browser to see the responsive layout at\nthe different breakpoints. Make sure to review these color and spacing tokens.\nThere are also a few breakpoint mixins that may be new to you.\n\n### Type\n\nOur `InfoCard` headings look to be too small. We need to increase their font\nsizes according to the design spec. Lets update the heading with the following\ntype style:\n\n```scss path=src/components/Info/_info.scss\n.info-card__heading {\n  @include type-style('productive-heading-03');\n}\n```\n\nAlso, the design has the last word in each subheading as bold. To accomplish\nthat, add this helper function after the import in `Info.js`.\n\n```javascript path=src/components/Info/Info.js\n// Take in a phrase and separate the third word in an array\nfunction createArrayFromPhrase(phrase) {\n  const splitPhrase = phrase.split(' ');\n  const thirdWord = splitPhrase.pop();\n  return [splitPhrase.join(' '), thirdWord];\n}\n```\n\nThen, update `InfoCard` to use `createArrayFromPhrase`.\n\n```javascript path=src/components/Info/Info.js\nconst InfoCard = (props) => {\n  const splitHeading = createArrayFromPhrase(props.heading);\n\n  return (\n    <Column sm={4} md={8} lg={4} className=\"info-card\">\n      <h4 className=\"info-card__heading\">\n        {`${splitHeading[0]} `}\n        <strong>{splitHeading[1]}</strong>\n      </h4>\n      <p className=\"info-card__body\">{props.body}</p>\n      {props.icon()}\n    </Column>\n  );\n};\n```\n\nFinally, add the declaration block in `_info.scss` to set `InfoCard` body copy\nstyles and to bottom-align the pictograms.\n\n```scss path=src/components/Info/_info.scss\n.info-card__body {\n  margin-top: $spacing-06;\n  flex-grow: 1; // fill space so pictograms are bottom aligned\n  @include type-style('body-long-01');\n\n  // prevent large line lengths between small and medium viewports\n  @include breakpoint-between(321px, md) {\n    max-width: 75%;\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## Check accessibility\n\nWe've added new markup and styles, so it's a good practice to check\n[Equal Access Checker](https://www.ibm.com/able/toolkit/tools/) and make sure\nour rendered markup is on the right track for accessibility.\n\nWith the browser extension installed, Chrome in this example, open Dev Tools and\nrun Accessibility Assessment.\n\n## Submit pull request\n\nWe're going to submit a pull request to verify completion of this tutorial step.\n\n### Continuous integration (CI) check\n\nRun the CI check to make sure we're all set to submit a pull request.\n\n```bash\nyarn ci-check\n```\n\n<InlineNotification>\n\n**Note:** Having issues running the CI check?\n[Step 1](</developing/react-tutorial/step-1#continuous-integration-(ci)-check>)\nhas troubleshooting notes that may help.\n\n</InlineNotification>\n\n### Git commit and push\n\nBefore we can create a pull request, format your code, then stage and commit all\nof your changes:\n\n```bash\nyarn format\ngit add --all && git commit -m \"feat(tutorial): complete step 4\"\n```\n\nThen, push to your repository:\n\n```bash\ngit push origin v11-next-step-4\n```\n\n<InlineNotification>\n\n**Note:** Having issues pushing your changes?\n[Step 1](/developing/react-tutorial/step-1#git-commit-and-push) has\ntroubleshooting notes that may help.\n\n</InlineNotification>\n\n### Pull request (PR)\n\nFinally, visit\n[carbon-tutorial-nextjs](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon-tutorial-nextjs)\nto \"Compare & pull request\". In doing so, make sure that you are comparing to\n`v11-next-step-4` into `base: v11-next-step-4`.\n\n<InlineNotification>\n\n**Note:** Expect your tutorial step PRs to be reviewed by the Carbon team but\nnot merged.

We'll\nassume that this informational section is used elsewhere on the site, meaning\nit's a great opportunity to build it as a reusable component.

Even though we're building multiple components, their names\nall start with `Info`, so it makes sense to have them share one folder in\ncomponents. Create these files:\n\n### Add files\n\n```bash\nsrc/components/Info\n├──_info.scss\n└──Info.js\n```\n\nImport `_info.scss` in `app.scss` after all of the `tutorial-header.scss`\nimport.\n\n```scss path=src/app/globals.scss\n@use '@/components/Info/info';\n```\n\n### InfoSection component\n\nLet's create the parent component that includes the \"The Principles\" heading.\nThat markup currently looks like this in `LandingPage`:\n\n```jsx path=src/app/home/page.js\n<Column lg={16} md={8} sm={4} className=\"landing-page__r3\">\n  <Grid>\n    <Column lg={4} md={4} sm={4}>\n      <h3 className=\"landing-page__label\">The Principles</h3>\n    </Column>\n    <Column lg={4} md={4} sm={4}>\n      Carbon is Open\n    </Column>\n    <Column lg={4} md={4} sm={4}>\n      Carbon is Modular\n    </Column>\n    <Column lg={4} md={4} sm={4}>\n      Carbon is Consistent\n    </Column>\n  </Grid>\n</Column>\n```\n\nWe want to do a few things when abstracting it to a component. First, we only\nwant this component's class names; we don't want to include `landing-page__r3`\nas that's specific to the landing page. For that we'll use React `props` so we\ncan pass in and use `props.className`.\n\nWe'll also:\n\n- Add component class names like `info-section`, `info-card`, and\n  `info-section__heading`\n- We will be using the `Grid` and `Column` components\n- Replace `The Principles` with `{props.heading}`\n- Replace columns 2 - 4 with `{props.children}`\n\nUsing `props` we can render any heading and any number of children components\n(`InfoCard` that we'll build soon.)\n\n```javascript path=src/components/Info/Info.js\nimport { Grid, Column } from '@carbon/react';\n\nconst InfoSection = (props) => (\n  <Grid className={`${props.className} info-section`}>\n    <Column md={8} lg={4} xlg={3}>\n      <h3 className=\"info-section__heading\">{props.heading}</h3>\n    </Column>\n    {props.children}\n  </Grid>\n);\n```\n\nAt this point let's import our needed styles and add styling for the new class\nnames that we just added.\n\n```scss path=src/components/Info/_info.scss\n@use '@carbon/react/scss/type' as *;\n\n.info-section__heading {\n  @include type-style('heading-01');\n}\n```\n\n### InfoCard component\n\nNext up we're going to build a component for columns 2 - 4, which currently\nlooks like `<Column md={4} lg={4}>Carbon is Open</Column>`. At the bottom of\n`Info.js`, add:\n\n```javascript path=src/components/Info/Info.js\nconst InfoCard = (props) => {\n  return (\n    <Column sm={4} md={8} lg={4} className=\"info-card\">\n      <h4 className=\"info-card__heading\">{props.heading}</h4>\n      <p className=\"info-card__body\">{props.body}</p>\n      {props.icon()}\n    </Column>\n  );\n};\n\nexport { InfoSection, InfoCard };\n```\n\n<InlineNotification>\n\n**Note:** Make sure to export the two components!\n\n</InlineNotification>\n\nIn doing so, we:\n\n- Added `info-card` classes\n- Used `props` to render the heading, body copy, and icon\n- Set columns to match the grid\n\n## Use components\n\nNothing is styled yet, but with our components built let's put them to use. In\n`LandingPage`, import the components towards the top of the file.\n\n```javascript path=src/app/home/page.js\nimport { InfoSection, InfoCard } from '@/components/Info/Info';\n```\n\nNext, we will install the pictograms we will use in the header.\n\n```bash\nyarn add @carbon/pictograms-react\n```\n\nWhile we're at the top of `LandingPage`, import the pictograms that we'll need\nas well.\n\n```javascript path=src/app/home/page.js\nimport {\n  Advocate,\n  Globe,\n  AcceleratingTransformation,\n} from '@carbon/pictograms-react';\n```\n\nWith everything imported, replace the current:\n\n```jsx path=src/app/home/page.js\n<Grid>\n  <Column md={4} lg={4}>\n    <h3 className=\"landing-page__label\">The Principles</h3>\n  </Column>\n  <Column md={4} lg={4}>\n    Carbon is Open\n  </Column>\n  <Column md={4} lg={4}>\n    Carbon is Modular\n  </Column>\n  <Column md={4} lg={4}>\n    Carbon is Consistent\n  </Column>\n</Grid>\n```\n\nWith the new components:\n\n```javascript path=src/app/home/page.js\n<InfoSection heading=\"The Principles\" className=\"landing-page__r3\">\n  <InfoCard\n    heading=\"Carbon is Open\"\n    body=\"It's a distributed effort, guided by the principles of the open-source movement.

Make sure to import the needed carbon styles.\n\n```scss path=src/components/Info/_info.scss\n@use '@carbon/react/scss/spacing' as *;\n@use '@carbon/react/scss/breakpoint' as *;\n@use '@carbon/react/scss/theme' as *;\n```\n\nWe will then add the following styles to the same file to style our info cards.\n\n```scss path=src/components/Info/_info.scss\n.info-card {\n  margin-top: $spacing-09;\n  display: flex;\n  flex-direction: column;\n  padding-left: 1rem;\n\n  svg {\n    margin-top: $spacing-09;\n  }\n\n  // top border in only small breakpoints to prevent overrides\n  @include breakpoint-down(md) {\n    &:not(:nth-child(2)) {\n      border-top: 1px solid $border-subtle-01;\n      padding-top: $spacing-09;\n    }\n  }\n\n  // left border in just the 2nd column items\n  @include breakpoint(md) {\n    &:nth-child(odd) {\n      border-left: 1px solid $border-subtle-01;\n    }\n  }\n\n  // left border in all items\n  @include breakpoint(lg) {\n    margin-top: 0;\n    border-left: 1px solid $border-subtle-01;\n\n    svg {\n      margin-top: $spacing-12;\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nOnce you save, go ahead and resize your browser to see the responsive layout at\nthe different breakpoints. Make sure to review these color and spacing tokens.\nThere are also a few breakpoint mixins that may be new to you.\n\n### Type\n\nOur `InfoCard` headings look to be too small. We need to increase their font\nsizes according to the design spec. Lets update the heading with the following\ntype style:\n\n```scss path=src/components/Info/_info.scss\n.info-card__heading {\n  @include type-style('productive-heading-03');\n}\n```\n\nAlso, the design has the last word in each subheading as bold. To accomplish\nthat, add this helper function after the import in `Info.js`.\n\n```javascript path=src/components/Info/Info.js\n// Take in a phrase and separate the third word in an array\nfunction createArrayFromPhrase(phrase) {\n  const splitPhrase = phrase.split(' ');\n  const thirdWord = splitPhrase.pop();\n  return [splitPhrase.join(' '), thirdWord];\n}\n```\n\nThen, update `InfoCard` to use `createArrayFromPhrase`.\n\n```javascript path=src/components/Info/Info.js\nconst InfoCard = (props) => {\n  const splitHeading = createArrayFromPhrase(props.heading);\n\n  return (\n    <Column sm={4} md={8} lg={4} className=\"info-card\">\n      <h4 className=\"info-card__heading\">\n        {`${splitHeading[0]} `}\n        <strong>{splitHeading[1]}</strong>\n      </h4>\n      <p className=\"info-card__body\">{props.body}</p>\n      {props.icon()}\n    </Column>\n  );\n};\n```\n\nFinally, add the declaration block in `_info.scss` to set `InfoCard` body copy\nstyles and to bottom-align the pictograms.\n\n```scss path=src/components/Info/_info.scss\n.info-card__body {\n  margin-top: $spacing-06;\n  flex-grow: 1; // fill space so pictograms are bottom aligned\n  @include type-style('body-long-01');\n\n  // prevent large line lengths between small and medium viewports\n  @include breakpoint-between(321px, md) {\n    max-width: 75%;\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## Check accessibility\n\nWe've added new markup and styles, so it's a good practice to check\n[Equal Access Checker](https://www.ibm.com/able/toolkit/tools/) and make sure\nour rendered markup is on the right track for accessibility.\n\nWith the browser extension installed, Chrome in this example, open Dev Tools and\nrun Accessibility Assessment.\n\n## Submit pull request\n\nWe're going to submit a pull request to verify completion of this tutorial step.\n\n### Continuous integration (CI) check\n\nRun the CI check to make sure we're all set to submit a pull request.\n\n```bash\nyarn ci-check\n```\n\n<InlineNotification>\n\n**Note:** Having issues running the CI check?\n[Step 1](</developing/react-tutorial/step-1#continuous-integration-(ci)-check>)\nhas troubleshooting notes that may help.\n\n</InlineNotification>\n\n### Git commit and push\n\nBefore we can create a pull request, format your code, then stage and commit all\nof your changes:\n\n```bash\nyarn format\ngit add --all && git commit -m \"feat(tutorial): complete step 4\"\n```\n\nThen, push to your repository:\n\n```bash\ngit push origin v11-next-step-4\n```\n\n<InlineNotification>\n\n**Note:** Having issues pushing your changes?\n[Step 1](/developing/react-tutorial/step-1#git-commit-and-push) has\ntroubleshooting notes that may help.\n\n</InlineNotification>\n\n### Pull request (PR)\n\nFinally, visit\n[carbon-tutorial-nextjs](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon-tutorial-nextjs)\nto \"Compare & pull request\".
