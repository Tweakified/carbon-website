Carbon incorporates many\nother accessibility considerations, some of which are described below.\n\n### Keyboard interactions\n\nTab order goes from slider to text input. Arrow keys are used to change the\nslider value. `Shift`+arrow changes the slider value by a larger increment (such\nas by 10 instead of 1). Users can also directly enter a value in the input.\n\n<Row>\n<Column colLg={8}>\n\n![example of slider keyboard interaction](images/slider-accessibility-1.png)\n\n<Caption>\n  Both the slider and input are in the tab order and keyboard operable.\n</Caption>\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\n### Labeling and updates\n\n<Row>\n<Column colLg={8}>\n\n![slider label is connected to slider control and text input](images/slider-accessibility-2.png)\n\n<Caption>\n  The slider label is programmatically associated with both the slider and\n  input.\n</Caption>\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\n<Row>\n<Column colLg={8}>\n\n<Video\n  src={localVideo}\n  poster={localPoster}\n  aria-label=\"pointer clicks on slider range and input updates to 80. input value changes to 75 and slider repositions to match\"\n/>\n\n<Caption>\n  The input value and slider position are in sync.

A value of `\"1\"` is recommended.\n- The `stepMultiplier` determines the value change when the keyboard is used to\n  alter the slider by pressing `Shift`+ Arrow key. A tenth of the total range is\n  recommended as a value, such as `\"10\"` in a 0-100 slider.\n- See the\n  [ARIA authoring practices](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices-1.2/#slider)\n  for more considerations.\n","type":"Mdx","contentDigest":"62f7f471c1aec92a37eba01e5c07fae7","owner":"gatsby-plugin-mdx","counter":4858},"frontmatter":{"title":"Slider","description":"Sliders provide a visual indication of adjustable content, where the user can move the handle along a horizontal track to increase or decrease the value.","tabs":["Usage","Style","Code","Accessibility"]},"exports":{},"rawBody":"---\ntitle: Slider\ndescription:\n  Sliders provide a visual indication of adjustable content, where the user can\n  move the handle along a horizontal track to increase or decrease the value.\ntabs: ['Usage', 'Style', 'Code', 'Accessibility']\n---\n\nimport localVideo from './videos/slider.mp4';\nimport localPoster from './images/slider-accessibility-3.png';\n\n<PageDescription>\n\nNo accessibility annotations are needed for sliders, but keep these\nconsiderations in mind if you are modifying Carbon or creating a custom\ncomponent.\n\n</PageDescription>\n\n<AnchorLinks>\n  <AnchorLink>What Carbon provides</AnchorLink>\n  <AnchorLink>Development considerations</AnchorLink>\n</AnchorLinks>\n\n## What Carbon provides\n\nCarbon bakes keyboard operation into its components, improving the experience of\nblind users and others who operate via the keyboard.
