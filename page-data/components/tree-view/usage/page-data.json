Following on\nwith the tree analogy, the tree view component has branch nodes that can be\nexpanded or collapsed to reveal or hide child nodes. The tree may also have leaf\nnodes. Leaf nodes can appear at any level of the tree hierarchy and do not have\nchild nodes.\n\n<Row>\n<Column colLg={8}>\n\n![Example of tree view with node icons](images/tree-view-usage-0.png)\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\n### When to use\n\n- Often used for navigating file system structures that are made up of folders\n  and documents.\n- To organize large amounts of information that can nest within multiple levels.\n\n### When not to use\n\n- To show and hide UI elements or content on a page.\n- When you only need one level of nested information. In this case, use a\n  different component like the [accordion](/components/accordion/usage/) or\n  [data table](/components/data-table/usage/) for expandable views that go one\n  level deep.\n- As the primary navigation in a product’s UI. Instead, use the UI Shell left\n  panel for product navigation. A combination of the\n  [UI shell left panel](/components/UI-shell-left-panel/usage/) and the\n  [breadcrumb](/components/breadcrumb/usage/) component can support an\n  information architecture several levels deep.\n\n## Formatting\n\n### Anatomy\n\nThe tree view is composed of branch and leaf nodes that are designed to nest and\norganize large sets of information.\n\n<Row>\n<Column colLg={12}>\n\n![Anatomy of tree view](images/tree-view-usage-1.png)\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\n1. **Branch node**: A node that has one or more child nodes. Can be expanded or\n   collapsed to reveal or hide child nodes.\n2. **Leaf node**: A node that has no child nodes and can appear at any level of\n   the tree view hierarchy. A leaf node may be referred to as a child node when\n   it is nested underneath a branch node.\n3. **Caret icon**: An icon to expand or collapse a branch node.\n4. **Node icon** (optional): An icon to visually represent and support a node\n   label, they can assist the user to scan different content types quickly.\n\n### Sizing\n\nThere are two node sizes: small (default), and extra small. Supporting two\ndifferent node sizes gives you more flexibility when structuring a tree view. If\nyou have a tree structure with complex nesting levels, use the extra small node\nsize to keep as much information in view as possible. When in doubt of which\nsize to use, use the small node size because it is our default.\n\n| Node size     | Height (px/rem) | Purpose                                                                                                                           |\n| ------------- | --------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| _Small_       | 32 / 2          | This is the default size and is the most commonly used as it has similar geometries as the UI shell left navigation panel.        |\n| _Extra small_ | 24 / 1.5        | Use when space is constricted on the page and/or when you need a more condensed view to show more of the tree view on the screen. |\n\n<Row>\n<Column colLg={8}>\n\n![Size comparison of the two nodes](images/tree-view-usage-2.png)\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\n### Alignment\n\n#### Stacking nodes\n\nNodes stack directly on top of each other with 0px space between them.

Make\nsure the icons accurately represent each node that they are related to. Using a\nfolder icon for branch nodes and a document icon for leaf nodes is a commonly\nrecognized pairing of icons used in tree view structures. If individual node\ndata cannot be identified, do not display icons. When in doubt, use nodes\nwithout icons.\n\n<Row>\n<Column colLg={8}>\n\n![Example of tree view with node icons](images/tree-view-usage-9.png)\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\n#### Aligning icons\n\nIt is important when adding icons to nodes in a tree view that there is an icon\npresent for every node. Not having an icon for every branch or leaf node can\ncause alignment inconsistencies and make groupings of nodes harder to visualize.\n\n<DoDontRow>\n<DoDont\ntype=\"do\"\ncolMd={4} colLg={4}\ncaption=\"Do consistently use icons for each node in a tree view.\">\n\n![Example of node icons used correctly in tree](./images/tree-view-usage-do-10a.png)\n\n</DoDont>\n<DoDont\ncolMd={4} colLg={4}\ntype=\"dont\" caption=\"Do not mix text-only and icon nodes in a tree view.\">\n\n![Incorrect example showing only some nodes using icons.](./images/tree-view-usage-dont-10b.png)\n\n</DoDont>\n</DoDontRow>\n\n## Related\n\n#### Tree view versus accordion\n\nUse the [accordion](/accordion/usage/) component when you need to organize\nlengthy information in sections that only go one level deep. Tree view is best\nused for nesting categories of information in a hierarchy of multiple levels /\nin a hierarchical form.\n\n#### Tree view versus UI Shell left panel\n\nUse the [UI Shell left panel](/UI-shell-left-panel/usage/) component for product\nnavigation. A combination of the UI Shell left panel and the\n[breadcrumb](/components/breadcrumb/usage/) component can support an information\narchitecture several levels deep of a product. Tree view is best used for on\npage navigation instead of being used for architecture of a website or product.\n\n#### Tree view versus data table\n\nUse the [data table](/components/data-table/usage/) component for displaying\nlarge amounts of detailed information that is easy to scan horizontally in one\nview. Data table rows can be expanded, but we recommend only expanding a row one\nlevel deep. Tree view is used to organize multiple nested levels of information\nwith concise labels that do not need to be organized in a column structure.\n\n## References\n\n- [Tree](https://www.w3.org/TR/aria-role/roles#tree) (W3C Recommendation)\n- [TreeView](https://www.w3.org/wiki/TreeView) (W3C Wiki 2012)\n- [Tree view React app](https://pages.github.ibm.com/conrad-schmidt/Tree/) (WKC)\n- [Tree view specifications](https://ibm.ent.box.com/s/azascty1rmgik858zy1kw3cw6f0a4zo1)\n  (WKC)\n- [Tree view WAI-ARIA practices](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices/#TreeView)\n  (W3C)\n\n## Feedback\n\nHelp us improve this component by providing feedback, asking questions, and\nleaving any other comments on\n[GitHub](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon-website/issues/new?assignees=&labels=feedback&template=feedback.md).\n","type":"Mdx","contentDigest":"e5c06aa2d84f9ec6a5f968adf87d6b94","owner":"gatsby-plugin-mdx","counter":4982},"frontmatter":{"title":"Tree view","description":"A tree view is a hierarchical structure that provides nested levels of navigation.","tabs":["Usage","Style","Code","Accessibility"]},"exports":{},"rawBody":"---\ntitle: Tree view\ndescription:\n  A tree view is a hierarchical structure that provides nested levels of\n  navigation.\ntabs: ['Usage', 'Style', 'Code', 'Accessibility']\n---\n\nimport A11yStatus from 'components/A11yStatus';\n\n<PageDescription>\n\nA tree view is a hierarchical structure that provides nested levels of\nnavigation.\n\n</PageDescription>\n\n<AnchorLinks>\n\n<AnchorLink>Live demo</AnchorLink>\n<AnchorLink>Overview</AnchorLink>\n<AnchorLink>Formatting</AnchorLink>\n<AnchorLink>Content</AnchorLink>\n<AnchorLink>Universal behaviors</AnchorLink>\n<AnchorLink>Related</AnchorLink>\n<AnchorLink>References</AnchorLink>\n<AnchorLink>Feedback</AnchorLink>\n\n</AnchorLinks>\n\n## Live demo\n\n<StorybookDemo\n  themeSelector\n  tall\n  url=\"https://react.carbondesignsystem.com\"\n  variants={[\n    {\n      label: 'Default',\n      variant: 'components-treeview--default',\n    },\n    {\n      label: 'With controlled expansion',\n      variant: 'components-treeview--with-controlled-expansion',\n    },\n    {\n      label: 'With icons',\n      variant: 'components-treeview--with-icons',\n    },\n  ]}\n/>\n\n<A11yStatus layout=\"cards\" components=\"Treeview\" />\n\n## Overview\n\nA tree view consists of nested heading levels that create a content hierarchy\nfor users and assist with navigating large amounts of information.

When in doubt, use nodes\nwithout icons.\n\n<Row>\n<Column colLg={8}>\n\n![Example of tree view with node icons](images/tree-view-usage-9.png)\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\n#### Aligning icons\n\nIt is important when adding icons to nodes in a tree view that there is an icon\npresent for every node. Not having an icon for every branch or leaf node can\ncause alignment inconsistencies and make groupings of nodes harder to visualize.\n\n<DoDontRow>\n<DoDont\ntype=\"do\"\ncolMd={4} colLg={4}\ncaption=\"Do consistently use icons for each node in a tree view.\">\n\n![Example of node icons used correctly in tree](./images/tree-view-usage-do-10a.png)\n\n</DoDont>\n<DoDont\ncolMd={4} colLg={4}\ntype=\"dont\" caption=\"Do not mix text-only and icon nodes in a tree view.\">\n\n![Incorrect example showing only some nodes using icons.](./images/tree-view-usage-dont-10b.png)\n\n</DoDont>\n</DoDontRow>\n\n## Related\n\n#### Tree view versus accordion\n\nUse the [accordion](/accordion/usage/) component when you need to organize\nlengthy information in sections that only go one level deep. Tree view is best\nused for nesting categories of information in a hierarchy of multiple levels /\nin a hierarchical form.\n\n#### Tree view versus UI Shell left panel\n\nUse the [UI Shell left panel](/UI-shell-left-panel/usage/) component for product\nnavigation. A combination of the UI Shell left panel and the\n[breadcrumb](/components/breadcrumb/usage/) component can support an information\narchitecture several levels deep of a product. Tree view is best used for on\npage navigation instead of being used for architecture of a website or product.\n\n#### Tree view versus data table\n\nUse the [data table](/components/data-table/usage/) component for displaying\nlarge amounts of detailed information that is easy to scan horizontally in one\nview. Data table rows can be expanded, but we recommend only expanding a row one\nlevel deep. Tree view is used to organize multiple nested levels of information\nwith concise labels that do not need to be organized in a column structure.\n\n## References\n\n- [Tree](https://www.w3.org/TR/aria-role/roles#tree) (W3C Recommendation)\n- [TreeView](https://www.w3.org/wiki/TreeView) (W3C Wiki 2012)\n- [Tree view React app](https://pages.github.ibm.com/conrad-schmidt/Tree/) (WKC)\n- [Tree view specifications](https://ibm.ent.box.com/s/azascty1rmgik858zy1kw3cw6f0a4zo1)\n  (WKC)\n- [Tree view WAI-ARIA practices](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices/#TreeView)\n  (W3C)\n\n## Feedback\n\nHelp us improve this component by providing feedback, asking questions, and\nleaving any other comments on\n[GitHub](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon-website/issues/new?assignees=&labels=feedback&template=feedback.md).\n","fileAbsolutePath":"/home/runner/work/carbon-website/carbon-website/src/pages/components/tree-view/usage.mdx"}}},"staticQueryHashes":["1364590287","137577622","2102389209","2456312558","2746626797","3018647132","3037994772","768070550"]}
