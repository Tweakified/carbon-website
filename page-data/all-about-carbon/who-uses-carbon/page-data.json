Designers can quickly\ncreate tailored solutions for our clients, drawing on Carbon's reusable kit of\nparts. This saves valuable time that can be spent on innovating new solutions.\n\nIn addition, Carbon enables product and .com designers across the organization\nto explore and deliver the full potential of a design, leveraging the work of\nother teams where possible, avoiding redesign and duplication of efforts,\nkeeping the focus on the distinct client use cases.\n\nHere are some ways designers can begin engaging with Carbon.\n\n#### Learn the system\n\n- Familiarize yourself with the Carbon\n  [foundational elements](/guidelines/2x-grid/overview), their usage\n  documentation, and the system's\n  [design principles](https://www.ibm.com/design/language/).\n\n- Familiarize yourself with usage and style guidance for all of Carbon's\n  [components](/components/overview/) and [patterns](/patterns/overview/).\n\n- Check out [design tutorials](/designing/get-started/) to learn more about some\n  of the foundational pieces of the design system.\n\n#### Get the tools\n\n- Visit the [Get started](/designing/get-started/) page to install the Figma\n  design kits.\n\n- Visit the [Other resources](/designing/design-resources/) page to find other\n  useful tools and plugins.\n\n#### Connect with the team\n\n- Find [meetups](/whats-happening/meetups/) for leveling up your skills,\n  connecting with your peers, and getting reviews on work in progress.\n\n- If you're confused or if you've spotted an inconsistency, reach out on our IBM\n  Slack channels.

More complex multiproduct stories are\neasier to tell when product experiences are in lock step.\n\nHere are some ways marketers can begin engaging with Carbon:\n\n- Visit [IBM Brand Center](https://www.ibm.com/brand) to learn more about\n  foundational brand compliance, as well as for the hero brand systems that\n  drive IBM's portfolio of products and experiences.\n\n- The majority of marketing experiences use Carbon web components. Visit\n  [Carbon for IBM.com](https://www.ibm.com/standards/web/carbon-for-ibm-dotcom/)\n  to ensure that these experiences are adhering to Carbon guidance.\n\n- Familiarize yourself with\n  [IBM.com web standards](https://www.ibm.com/standards/web/) to assess the\n  legal compliance of your experience.\n\n- Make sure all digital experiences by third parties meet IBM-A accessibility\n  requirements:\n\n  - [Marketing materials](https://www.ibm.com/able/toolkit/launch/readiness#marketing-materials)\n  - [Supplier and Partnership Accessibility Requirements and Process](http://ibm.biz/SupplierAccessibility)\n  - [Accessibility guidelines for suppliers](http://blob:https//www.ibm.com/c4c955b3-b746-c74c-86de-c852f7f1462a)\n\n## Product managers\n\nCarbon accelerates team productivity and time to market. It improves business\noutcomes such as increased lifetime value, revenue, NPS, and decreased churn.\nTeams using Carbon have also won awards in both the\n[product](https://pages.github.ibm.com/cdai-design/awards) and the\n[digital](https://medium.com/design-ibm/ibm-cloud-app-id-and-assist-me-win-indigo-design-awards-47600197f780)\nrealms.\n\nHere are some ways product managers can begin engaging with Carbon:\n\n- Stay current with Carbon's [releases and roadmap](/whats-happening/releases/)\n  to prioritize upgrading Carbon's new assets, upstream fixes,\n  designer/developer workflow improvements, and tooling enhancements.\n\n- Provide the Carbon team with adoption and migration feedback, as well as\n  measured product performance with regard to Carbon, providing a healthy\n  collaboration loop. Here are some\n  [migration worksheets and other resources](https://pages.github.ibm.com/cdai-design/dux/).\n\n## Sales\n\nMultiproduct stories are easier to tell and sell when product experiences work\ntogether seamlessly. Suites of products built on the same foundation, that have\nthe same interactions are a dream to demo.\n\nCarbon also extends\n[IBM iX's capabilities](https://blog.adobe.com/en/publish/2019/11/04/adobe-and-ibm-ix-extend-partnership-to-help-enterprises-design-powerful-and-consistent-customer-experiences.html#gs.101gaxd),\nallowing iX customers to implement and customize Carbon, showcasing its\nadaptability as a white-label design system.\n\nHere are some ways people in sales can begin engaging with Carbon:\n\n- Consultants who are selling digital solutions to clients should understand the\n  benefits of Carbon for rapid prototyping, demo'ing and building.\n\n- Our IBM consultants are the champions of third party Carbon use. Carbon looks\n  to them for the following:\n\n  - Creating case studies that highlight the effective use and benefits of\n    Carbon.\n  - Providing information about gaps in third party capabilities, as well as\n    prioritized client requests.\n\n- Stay up to date with Carbon's\n  [roadmap and releases](/whats-happening/releases/).\n\n## Support\n\nProduct experiences that are built on the same foundation and work together\nseamlessly to reduce cognitive load for users, thereby reducing user errors and\nquestions, and significantly reducing the need for support.\n\nConsistent experiences also result in less need for extensive training and\nonboarding resources; learning can be leveraged across multiple spaces.\n\nHere are some ways people in support roles can begin engaging with Carbon:\n\n- Stay up to date with Carbon's\n  [roadmap and releases](/whats-happening/releases/).\n\n- Make a [GitHub issue](/contributing/bugs-and-requests/) to report bugs or\n  address gaps.\n\n- Report issues in these primary support Slack channels:\n  - [#carbon-design-system](https://ibm-studios.slack.com/messages/C0M053VPT/)\n  - [#carbon-components](https://ibm-studios.slack.com/archives/C046Y0YUD)\n  - [#carbon-react](https://ibm-studios.slack.com/archives/C2K6RFJ1G)\n","type":"Mdx","contentDigest":"78da140a31b7be71acfca798e3017562","owner":"gatsby-plugin-mdx","counter":4891},"frontmatter":{"title":"Who uses Carbon?","description":"Carbon is for all members of a cross-functional product team—designers, developers, marketers and offering managers.
