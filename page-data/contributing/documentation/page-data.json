Some components require more complex documentation\nthan others, but you should cover each topic included in the following markdown\ntemplates: usage, style, code, and accessibility.\n\nCheck out Carbon's handy markdown\n[styling cheatsheet](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon-website/wiki/Markdown-cheatsheet)\nfor how to style content.\n\n### Usage template: for components with one variant\n\nThe usage template helps describe when to use a component and how it works. You\ncan see this template in use for components with only one variant:\n[Accordion](/components/accordion/usage) and\n[Checkbox](/components/checkbox/usage).\n\n```markdown\n---\ntitle: Component name\ndescription: Explains what the component is in one or two sentences.\ntabs: ['Usage', 'Style', 'Code', 'Accessibility']\n---\n\n<PageDescription>\n\n<!-- Explains what the component is in one or two sentences. -->\n\n</PageDescription>\n\n<AnchorLinks>\n\n<AnchorLink>Overview</AnchorLink> <AnchorLink>Live demo</AnchorLink>\n<AnchorLink>Formatting</AnchorLink> <AnchorLink>Content</AnchorLink>\n<AnchorLink>Behaviors</AnchorLink> <AnchorLink>Modifiers</AnchorLink>\n<AnchorLink>Related</AnchorLink> <AnchorLink>References</AnchorLink>\n<AnchorLink>Feedback</AnchorLink>\n\n</AnchorLinks>\n\n## Overview\n\n<!--\nInclude a paragraph or two that describes the primary use cases for the component and details about how it helps the user achieve any tasks.\n\nExample:\n\n*The accordion component delivers large amounts of content in a small space through progressive disclosure. The header title give the user a high level overview of the content allowing the user to decide which sections to read.*\n-->\n\n### When to use\n\n<!--\nInclude examples for when to use this component and how it addresses the use case / solves a problem for the user.\n\nExample:\n\n*Dropdowns can be used in forms on full pages, in modals, or on side panels. The dropdown component is used to filter or sort contents on a page. It is a stylized version of the select component, and can be styled as needed.*\n-->\n\n### When not to use (optional)\n\n<!--\nIf there are two similar components that are used for different use cases, spell that out here and explain which component to use for each use case.\n\nExample:\n\n*It is best practice not to use a dropdown if there are two or fewer options to choose from. In this case, use a radio button group instead.*\n-->\n\n## Live demo\n\n<!--Include component demo here.-->\n\n## Formatting\n\n### Anatomy\n\n<!--The anatomy section has a set format and includes an example component with numbered callouts to each of the component elements. A list below provides the name of the element in bold and explains its purpose. Be sure to note if the element is optional.\n\nSee [Notification](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/components/notification/usage#anatomy) for an example.-->\n\n### Sizing (optional)\n\n<!--List out any component sizes that are available and provide some guidance about how to choose the best size for the use case. Other topics that may be covered here include considerations around maximum heights, maximum widths, and responsive resizing.\n\nExample:\n\n*There are four responsive modal sizes: xs, small, default, large. Choose a size that works best for the amount of modal content you have. Modals with short messages should use a xs or small modal to avoid long single lines; for complex components, like data table the default or large modal will be more accommodating.*\n-->\n\n### Alignment (optional)\n\n<!--\nConsider the relationship with other items that are the same. How do they sit in groups? What is their juxtaposition. For example:\n\n- Checkbox, radio button—what is their relationship horizontally and vertically?\n- Notifications—how do they stack?\n- Button—what happens when there's more than one?\n\nWe have some alignment content in the Structure section of the Style tab, so consider the relationship between the two tabs and include a cross-reference if necessary.\n\nExample:\n\n*Inside of a modal, body copy, including titles, have a 20% margin-right. However, form inputs and other components expand the full width of a modal window.*\n-->\n\n### Placement\n\n<!--\nDiscuss placement of the component in a broader context, that is:\n\n- alongside other components\n- within the grid\n\nYou may want to include a link here to the Structure section of the Style tab.\n\nExample:\n\n*Accordions can be placed with main page content or placed inside of a container such as a side panel or tile. When placing an accordion on the 2x Grid the indented title aligns to the grid columns and the top and bottom borders hang in the gutter.*\n-->\n\n## Content\n\n### Main elements\n\n<!--\nIdentify the content elements within the component, for example, title, label, placeholder text, links. Use H4s for the element names and provide guidelines underneath for each element.\n\nBriefly explain any particular rules such as phrase structure, word limits, and character limits. Where there's more than one rule, use bullets to list out the multiple rules for ease of reading. If necessary, refer out to main content guidelines for more detailed information, for example, capitalization, or recommended action labels.\n\nSee [Checkbox](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/components/checkbox/usage#content) and [Modal](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/components/modal/usage#content) for examples.\n-->\n\n### Overflow content\n\n<!--\nExplain how overflow content should be handled.\n\nExample:\n\n*When the accordion content is longer than the viewport the whole accordion should vertically scroll. Content should not scroll inside of an individual panel. Content should never scroll horizontally in an accordion.*\n-->\n\n### Further guidance\n\n<!--\nFor further content guidance, see Carbon's [content guidelines]([https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/guidelines/content/general](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/guidelines/content/general)).\n-->\n\n## Behaviors\n\n<!--\nDetermine which component behaviors apply to your component, and include from the following sections as needed.\n-->\n\n### States\n\n<!--\nIf including any information on this topic, include the following line:\n\nFor detailed visual information about the various states for this component, see the Style tab.\n\nExample:\n\n*The accordion component has two main states: collapsed and expanded. The chevron icon at the end of the accordion indicates which state the accordion is in. The chevron points down to indicate collapsed and up to indicate expanded.*\n-->\n\n### Interactions\n\n<!--\nInclude all possible interactions with the component, including:\n\n- Mouse\n- Keyboard\n- Screen readers\n\nSee [Accordion](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/components/accordion/usage#interactions) for an example.\n-->\n\n### Validation\n\n<!--\nInclude any guidelines for data validation and accompanying messaging. See [Form](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/components/form/usage/#validation-and-errors) for an example.\n-->\n\n### Responsive behavior\n\n<!--\nInclude details about how the component should behave in responsive situations.\n-->\n\n### Default selection\n\n<!--\nCover guidance around default settings and provide rationale. See [Form](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/components/form/usage/#default-values) and [Radio button](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/components/radio-button/usage/#default-selection) for examples.\n-->\n\n### Clickable areas\n\n<!--\nProvide details about the clickable areas of the component.\n-->\n\n### Loading\n\n<!--\nIf applicable, use this section to cross reference to the specific loading type in the [Loading component](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/patterns/loading-pattern) and/or the [Loading pattern](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/patterns/loading-pattern/).\n-->\n\n## Modifiers\n\n<!--\nThe modifiers section shows different ways of styling the component. Here are some examples:\n\n- adding an icon to a [button](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/components/button/usage/#variations)\n- adding a button to a [notification](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/components/notification/usage/#anatomy)\n- styling a dropdown to appear inline with other content\n- using high and low contrast styles for [notifications](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/components/notification/usage/#high-and-low-contrast)\n- using a \"light\" variant in a [text input](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/components/text-input/code)\n-->\n\n## Related\n\n<!--\nDid you reference other components or patterns? List them here.\n\nIf necessary, clarify any differences between this component and related components.\n-->\n\n## References\n\n<!--\nInclude any research, citations, books or articles that you found helpful.\n-->\n\n## Feedback\n\n<!--Include a request for feedback here.-->\n\nHelp us improve this component by providing feedback, asking questions, and\nleaving any other comments on\n[GitHub](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon-website/issues/new?assignees=&labels=feedback&template=feedback.md).\n```\n\n### Usage template: for components with multiple variants\n\nUse this template for documenting components that have multiple types or\nvariants.

You can reference this [table generator](https://www.tablesgenerator.com/markdown_tables) for easy table creation.\n\nAdd supporting images to this section, with at least one image showing structure and another showing spacing measurements. Images should be accompanied by a descriptive caption and relate to the spec charts. Note we use the `image--fixed` markdown component in the Structure section to maintain size accuracy.\n\nVariants: You may need to provide additional specs for component variants like default versus flush alignment. For each variant, make a new h3 section and give it a name. The following are example pairs of section headers:\n\nDefault style text area structure\nFluid style text area structure\n\nDefault style text input structure\nFluid style text input structure\n\nDefault alignment structure\nFlush alignment structure\n\nModifiers: If you need to document additional ways of styling a component, add h3 sections under Structure as needed. Here are some example cases where a modifier section has been added:\n\n- adding an icon to a [button](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/components/button/usage/#variations)\n- adding a button to a [notification](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/components/notification/usage/#anatomy)\n- using high and low contrast styles for [notifications](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/components/notification/usage/#high-and-low-contrast)\n\nThe following content shows example documentation from [Accordion](https://carbondesignsystem.com/components/accordion/style), which has no variants and therefore does not need any h3 headers.\n-->\n\n| Element | Property    | px/rem   | Spacing token |\n| ------- | ----------- | -------- | ------------- |\n| Header  | height      | 40 / 2.5 | –             |\n| Item    | border-top  | 1        | –             |\n| Title   | margin-left | 16 / 1   | `$spacing-05` |\n\n<div className=\"image--fixed\">\n\n![Structure measurements for default accordion alignment](images/accordion-style-4.png)\n\n</div>\n\n<Caption>\n  Structure measurements for default accordion alignment. | px / rem\n</Caption>\n\n<br />\n\n<div className=\"image--fixed\">\n\n![Spacing measurements for default accordion alignment](images/accordion-style-5.png)\n\n</div>\n\n<Caption>\n  Spacing measurements for default accordion alignment. | px / rem\n</Caption>\n\n## Size\n\n<!--\nIn the size section, provide a table of component size names and height. Be sure to cross-link this to the size section in the usage tab, which is where you should provide guidance about how to choose the best size for a given use case.\n\nExample: The following table shows an example from [Button](https://carbondesignsystem.com/components/button/style).\n-->\n\nThere are six button sizes: small, medium, large productive, large expressive,\nextra large, and 2XL.

The Breadcrumb component accepts a list of BreadcrumbItem components as children and each BreadcrumbItem is responsible for displaying the page links in the hierarchy.\n-->\n\n### Skeleton\n\n<!--\nInclude which component/s to use for the skeleton state and why it might be useful.\n\nExample:\n\n*You can use the BreadcrumbSkeleton component to render a skeleton variant of an breadcrumb. This is useful to display while content in your breadcrumb is being fetched from an external resource like an API.*\n-->\n\n## [Use case, for example, Skeleton state or Sorting]\n\n<!--\nEach use-case of this component becomes its own section. For example,\nif an accordion had a skeleton then you would name this section Skeleton.\n\nIf the component had a specific piece of functionality or behavior, like\nhow you can sort with a Data Table, then Sorting would be the name of this\nsection.\n\nThis section should include an explainer for the use-case and when to use it,\nalong with a code snippet that someone could bring into their project.\n-->\n\n## Component API\n\n### [Component name] props\n\n| Prop        | Type     | Required | Default | Description |\n| ----------- | -------- | -------- | ------- | ----------- |\n| `className` | `string` | –        | –       | –           |\n\n<!--\n* Only specific required as `true`, if it's false you don't need to indicate that\n* Specify the default value if applicable\n* Provide a description if applicable\n* Annotate the type using TypeScript type annotations\n* Empty cells should be filled with en dashes (–)\n* Table should be sorted in alphabetical order\n-->\n\n#### [Component name][prop name]\n\n<!--\nUsed to clarify prop usage, provide additional info or snippets\n-->\n\n## References\n\n<!--\nA place for references, links, or a way clarify points made earlier\nin the documentation.\n-->\n\n## Feedback\n\nHelp us improve this component by providing feedback, asking questions, and\nleaving any other comments on\n[GitHub](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon-website/issues/new?assignees=&labels=feedback&template=feedback.md).\n```\n\n### Accessibility template\n\nThe accessibility template helps designers and developers ensure components are\naccessible. The published information helps users understand all the\naccessibility considerations that are baked into Carbon. Refer to our guidance\non creating the\n[keyboard interaction visuals](https://github.com/hiraaeth/component-contribution-accessibility/wiki/High-fidelity-keyboard-interaction-visuals).\n\n```markdown\n---\ntitle: Component name (you won't need to write this)\ndescription: Component description (you won't need to write this)\ntabs: ['Usage', 'Style', 'Code', 'Accessibility']\n---\n\n<PageDescription>\n\n<!--\nThere are 2 stock page descriptions.\nChoose the first example if designers need to include annotations in their wireframes to make the component accessible. Choose the second if the component is accessible without additional design decisions.\n** If example 2 is used, the Design recommendations section and its anchor link should be removed.\n\nExample 1:\nDesign annotations are needed for specific instances shown below, but for the\nstandard [component_name] component, Carbon already incorporates accessibility.\n\nExample 2:\nNo accessibility annotations are needed for [component_name]s, but keep these considerations in\nmind if you are modifying Carbon or creating a custom component.\n-->\n\n</PageDescription>\n\n<AnchorLinks>\n  <AnchorLink>What Carbon provides</AnchorLink>\n  <!--\n  Only include Design recommendations if there are actually tasks for a designer to do\n  -->\n  <AnchorLink>Design recommendations</AnchorLink>\n  <AnchorLink>Development considerations</AnchorLink>\n</AnchorLinks>\n\n## What Carbon provides\n\nCarbon bakes keyboard operation into its components, improving the experience of\nblind users and others who operate via the keyboard. Carbon incorporates many\nother accessibility considerations, some of which are described below.\n\n### Keyboard interaction\n\n<!--\nThis keyboard section introduction text can give details of keyboard operation. For actionable components, begin by talking about the navigation via the tab stop, then discuss common interactions keys. For components with subcomponents, unless there is little interaction for the subcomponent, consider splitting the subcomponent considerations into a separate paragraph, separated by an illustration. Where operation is more complicated, separate headings for Keyboard navigation and Keyboard interaction can exist.Keyboard keys should be referred to with code styling.\n\nExample 1:\n-->\n\nEach accordion is a tab stop. `Space` or `Enter` keys expand or collapse\naccordions, which are collapsed by default. Interactive elements within expanded\naccordions integrate into the tab order automatically.\n\n<!--\nExample 2:\nEach page link in the breadcrumb is reached by `Tab` and activated by `Enter`. The current\npage, if listed in the breadcrumb, is not a link. If the breadcrumb is truncated, the ellipsis button\nfor the overflow menu is in the tab order. See [overflow menu]((https://carbondesignsystem.com/components/overflow-menu/usage/)) for details on its keyboard operation\n-->\n\n<!--\n**Images**\nUse one image to document keyboard navigation. If the component has limited operation functionality, it may also be incorporated in the same image. Otherwise, the operation should be dealt with in a separate image.\nNormally these images go across 8 columns.\nimages should follow the naming convention (component_name-accessibility-1.png\nThe ALT text text for the first image can be fairly generic, since the image is just restating information in the prior paragraph.\nThe caption should likewise summarize something already described in the preceding paragraph. No new information should be given in the caption. Due to technology constraints, keystroke names in the captions are not given any markdown styling.\nExample:\n![example of breadcrumb keyboard interaction](images/breadcrumb-accessibility-1.png)\n<Caption>\n  The breadcrumb's links are reached by Tab and activated by Enter.\n</Caption>\n-->\n<Row>\n<Column colLg={8}>\n\n![example of (componet_name) keyboard interaction](images/component_name-accessibility-1.png)\n\n<Caption>\n  The (component_name) is reached by Tab and activated by Enter.\n</Caption>\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\n<!--\nThe Design recommendations section should only be included if annotations are needed\n-->\n\n## Design recommendations\n\nDesign annotations are needed for the following instances.\n\n<!--\nSome of the possible subheadings here include:\n- headings\n- alignment\n- labeling\n- meaningful order\n\nEach should have a level 3 heading, a descriptive paragraph and a supporting image.\n\nExample:\n\n### Headings\nCarbon accordions are not set as headings by default. For improved accessibility, annotate accordions as headings on the first occurrence in a product. Annotate the heading level of accordions as needed.\n\n-->\n\n## Development considerations\n\nKeep these considerations in mind if you are modifying Carbon or creating a\ncustom component.\n\n<!--\nProvide a bulleted list of implementation considerations for ensuring accessibility. If there is the ability to refernce the IBM toolkit or the ARIA authoring practices, that should be done.\n\n- Use dashed bullets and ensure code is styled as code and consistently appears with the\nfollowing symbols: <element>, 'variable' and \"value\".\n- End each bulleted list item with a period.\n\nExample:\n- See the [ARIA authoring practices](https://w3c.github.io/aria-practices/#tooltip) for more considerations.\n\n-->\n```\n\n## Documenting patterns\n\nPatterns show reusable combinations of components and templates that address\ncommon user objectives with sequences and flows. Because they are more\ncomplicated than components, you may need to adjust the topic order to best tell\nthe story — but your pattern should cover all of the topics outlined in the\nfollowing templates.\n\n### Pattern template: for one variant\n\nUse this template for documenting patterns that have a single variant. You can\nsee this template in use for [Toolbar](/patterns/text-toolbar-pattern/).\n\n```markdown\n---\ntitle: Pattern name\ndescription: Explain the pattern in one or two sentences.\n---\n\n<PageDescription>\n\nExplain the pattern in one or two sentences.\n\n</PageDescription>\n\n<AnchorLinks>\n\n<AnchorLink>Overview</AnchorLink>  \n<AnchorLink>Designing with [pattern]</AnchorLink>  \n<AnchorLink>Accessibility</AnchorLink>  \n<AnchorLink>Related</AnchorLink>  \n<AnchorLink>References</AnchorLink>  \n<AnchorLink>Feedback</AnchorLink>\n\n</AnchorLinks>\n\n## Overview\n\nThis section answers the question: “What problem does this pattern solve?”\n\n- Define the use of your pattern and what it does.\n- Explain a user’s needs and how the pattern meets those needs.\n\n### Anatomy\n\nInclude an image with callouts explaining each part of the pattern. See the\n[Forms pattern](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/patterns/forms-pattern#anatomy-of-a-form)\nfor an example.\n\n### When to use\n\nInclude a short list describing situations where this pattern could be applied.\n\nFor example, use this pattern when:\n\n- Situation 1\n- Situation 2\n\n### When not to use (optional)\n\nIf required, include a short explanation about when not to use this pattern.\n\n## Designing with [pattern]\n\nThis section explains the pattern in detail. Use a combination of written\nexplanations and visuals to tell the story.\n\nDescribe the elements, components, and content that make up the pattern.\n\nShow the pattern in context. Use visuals throughout your written commentary to\nillustrate your guidance.\n\nDifferent patterns require different visuals to best explain the behaviors and\nhierarchy. Choose the options that make the most sense for the story you are\ntelling.\n\n- Use annotated wireframes or sketches to explain the visual hierarchy of\n  components.\n- Create high-level user flows to explain the big picture.\n- Create a functional prototype if that is the best way to illustrate the\n  pattern's behavior.\n\nProvide a Sketch file with any symbols you've created in the development of this\npattern.\n\nUse the following headings as guidelines for the kind of information to include.\nDepending on the requirements of your pattern, you may choose to present these\nheadings as H2 headings or as H3 headings underneath a more general \"Designing\nwith [pattern]\" heading. See the\n[Dialogs pattern](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/patterns/dialog-pattern/#designing-with-dialogs)\nas an example.\n\n### Types of [pattern]\n\nIf the pattern has different types or visual treatments that serve different use\ncases, cover them here and be sure to explain when to use each type.\n\nSee the\n[Empty states](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/patterns/empty-states-pattern#when-to-use)\npattern and the\n[Notification](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/patterns/notification-pattern#notification-types)\npattern for examples.\n\n### Behaviors\n\nDescribe behaviors, including guidance on interactions, and changes in states\nand content.\n\n### Best practices\n\nAre there any do's and don'ts specific to this variant? Include them here.\n\nFor examples of how to lay out this kind of information, see\n[Dropdown](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/components/dropdown/usage) and\n[Modal](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/components/modal/usage#variations).\n\n### Visual guidance\n\nCover any important topics such as alignment, image choice considerations, or\nspecial treatments in situations with no data or multiple instances of elements.\nSee the\n[Empty states pattern](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/patterns/empty-states-pattern#visual-guidelines-for-smaller-empty-spaces)\nand the\n[Forms pattern](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/patterns/forms-pattern#designing-a-form)\nfor examples.\n\n### Other use cases\n\nIf there are use cases that require a different solution, include those here\nwith corresponding explanations and visuals. Be sure to explain the reasons for\nusing one solution over another.\n\n## Accessibility\n\nEvaluate your pattern to ensure it meets\n[accessibility standards](notion://www.notion.so/guidelines/accessibility/overview)\nand guidelines, and provide details of compliance.\n\nFor example, “Users should be able to TAB into the input field of the search box\nto begin typing and press ENTER to run the search query.”\n\nFor examples, see the\n[Text toolbar pattern](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/patterns/text-toolbar-pattern#accessibility)\nand the\n[Search pattern](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/patterns/search-pattern#accessibility).\n\n## Related\n\nWhich components are used when building this pattern? Did you reference other\npatterns? List them here.\n\nIf necessary, clarify any differences between this pattern and related patterns.\n\n## References\n\nHelp designers understand your process by explaining your rationale for the way\nyou implemented the pattern. Include any research, citations, books or articles\nthat you found helpful.\n\n## Feedback\n\nHelp us improve this pattern by providing feedback, asking questions, and\nleaving any other comments on\n[GitHub](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon-website/issues/new?assignees=&labels=feedback&template=feedback.md).\n```\n\n### Pattern template: for multiple variants\n\nUse this template for documenting patterns that have multiple types or variants.\nYou can see this template in use for [Dialog](/patterns/dialog-pattern/) and\n[Loading](/patterns/loading-pattern/).\n\n```markdown\n---\ntitle: Pattern name (multiple variants)\ndescription: Explain the pattern in one or two sentences.\n---\n\n<PageDescription>\n\nExplain the pattern in one or two sentences.\n\n</PageDescription>\n\n<AnchorLinks>\n\n<AnchorLink>Overview</AnchorLink>  \n<AnchorLink>Designing with [pattern]</AnchorLink>  \n<AnchorLink>[Pattern] variant</AnchorLink>  \n<AnchorLink>Accessibility</AnchorLink>  \n<AnchorLink>Related</AnchorLink>  \n<AnchorLink>References</AnchorLink>  \n<AnchorLink>Feedback</AnchorLink>\n\n</AnchorLinks>\n\n## Overview\n\nInclude a paragraph or two that describes the primary use cases for the pattern\nand details about how it helps the user achieve any tasks.\n\nThe purpose of this overview section is to set context for your readers.\n\n### Anatomy\n\nIt can be helpful to show images of all of the variants in small form together.\nSee the\n[Dialogs pattern](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/patterns/dialog-pattern#modal-variants)\nand the\n[Notifications pattern](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/patterns/notification-pattern#notification-types)\nfor examples of this visual treatment.\n\nAlternatively, if there is one variant that includes common aspects of the\npattern that are seen across all or most variants, include an image with\ncallouts explaining each part of the pattern. See the\n[Forms pattern](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/patterns/forms-pattern#anatomy-of-a-form)\nfor an example.\n\n### [Pattern] variants\n\nInclude a table with the variants discussed in this pattern. Include a short\ndescription about the usage of each pattern variant. The table in\n[Modal component](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/components/modal/usage/#variants)\nis a good example of the level of detail required.\n\nThe variant names should link to the H2 headings for the variants below.\n\nAdd more columns, if needed. For example, you could add a column that includes\nshort explanations about when not to use the variant and guide the user to an\nalternative that may be more appropriate.\n\n## Designing with [pattern]\n\nThis section covers _universal_ content related to all variants, and depending\non the requirements of your pattern, may include the following H3s.\n\n### When to use\n\nIf you need to elaborate on the content included in the pattern variants table\nin the Overview, include that detail here. The\n[Notifications pattern](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/patterns/notification-pattern#when-to-use)\nis a good example of the kind of content to include.\n\n### When not to use (optional)\n\nIf required, include a short explanation about when not to use this pattern and\nprovide alternatives.\n\n### Universal behaviors\n\nDescribe any behaviors that are universal to all pattern variants, and include\nguidance on interactions, and changes in states and content.\n\n### Best practices\n\nList out best practices and include any design considerations that help with\nmaking choices.\n\n- Do's\n- Dont's\n\n### Visual guidance\n\nCover any important topics such as alignment, image choice considerations, or\nspecial treatments in situations with no data or multiple instances of elements.\nSee\n[Empty states](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/patterns/empty-states-pattern#visual-guidelines-for-smaller-empty-spaces)\nfor an example.\n\n### Other considerations\n\nIf there are any other considerations particular to your pattern that are\napplicable to all variants, include them here.\n\n## [Pattern] variant\n\nRename this H2 heading with the first pattern variant name, and repeat for all\nvariants within this pattern.

You can use the second person pronoun (\"you\").\n- Keep sentences and paragraphs short and focused.\n- Be clear and concise by removing unnecessary words. The more concise the text,\n  the easier it is for all users to understand.\n- Use sentence case for everything, including component names, e.g. Content\n  switcher and Data table.\n\n## Publishing updates\n\nReady to get your work reviewed and published? There are two ways to do this,\ndepending on your experience with GitHub. You may also draft your content and\nbring it to\n[office hours](https://ec.yourlearning.ibm.com/w3/series/10289694?layout=grid&_ga=2.129990351.257088430.1694013487-309583455.1691093939&_gl=1*16l2j5q*_ga*MzA5NTgzNDU1LjE2OTEwOTM5Mzk.*_ga_FYECCCS21D*MTY5NDAzMjgwMi4xMS4xLjE2OTQwMzQ0OTEuMC4wLjA.)\nto get further guidance.\n\n### Editing in browser\n\n#### How to edit an existing page\n\nIf you are editing an existing docs page, the easiest option is to click on the\n`Edit this page on GitHub` link that appears at the bottom of every page on the\nsite. The link opens the specific GitHub page where you can edit the content and\nthen propose the change with a pull request. Your changes will be reviewed by\nthe Carbon team. This is the easiest and most commonly used approach by\ncontributors.\n\n<Video\n  src=\"/videos/edit-this-page-contribution.mp4\"\n  poster=\"/videos/edit-this-page-contribution.png\"\n>\n  <track default srcLang=\"en\" title=\"How to edit an existing page\" />\n</Video>\n\n#### How to add a new page or image\n\nTo start, go to the Carbon website repository\n[here](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon-website). Navigate to the\nleft hand corner above the files and click `main`. From here, type in a new\nbranch name that reflects your work. For\nexample,`add-accordion-accessibility-guidance`. Once that new branch is created,\nnavigate to where the new file will be stored for a\n[component](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon-website/tree/main/src/pages/components)\nor\n[pattern](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon-website/tree/main/src/pages/patterns).\n\nEnsure you are in the branch you created, then navigate to `Add file` in the\nupper right-hand corner. To add a new guidance page, click `create new file`\nbutton. Title the file one of the following: `usage.mdx`, `style.mdx`,\n`code.mdx`, or `accessibility.mdx`. To add an image, make sure you are in the\nimage folder and click `Upload files`.\n\nAfter filling out the markdown template or adding an image, click\n`Commit changes`. Describe your work and double check that you are on the branch\nyou created. If you are in the wrong branch, you will have to copy your content\ninto the correct branch.\n\n<Video\n  src=\"/videos/inline-edit-contribution.mp4\"\n  poster=\"/videos/inline-edit-contribution.png\"\n>\n  <track default srcLang=\"en\" title=\"How to add a new page or image\" />\n</Video>\n\nOnce you have committed your changes, go to the\n[Pull requests](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon-website/pulls)\npage. Compare `base: main` to your branch and click `Create new pull request`.\nYour contribution will be reviewed by the Carbon team!\n\n### Editing in a local environment\n\nAlternatively, if you are planning regular or more comprehensive content updates\nand are up for a more advanced option, you'll want to fork the repo and install\nsome of the tools we use to build the website. This will create an easier\nworkflow for you long term, but takes some time to set up.\n\nIf you are familiar with this process, you can\n[fork the repo](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon-website/blob/main/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#submission-guidelines)\nand get started.

Some components require more complex documentation\nthan others, but you should cover each topic included in the following markdown\ntemplates: usage, style, code, and accessibility.\n\nCheck out Carbon's handy markdown\n[styling cheatsheet](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon-website/wiki/Markdown-cheatsheet)\nfor how to style content.\n\n### Usage template: for components with one variant\n\nThe usage template helps describe when to use a component and how it works. You\ncan see this template in use for components with only one variant:\n[Accordion](/components/accordion/usage) and\n[Checkbox](/components/checkbox/usage).\n\n```markdown\n---\ntitle: Component name\ndescription: Explains what the component is in one or two sentences.\ntabs: ['Usage', 'Style', 'Code', 'Accessibility']\n---\n\n<PageDescription>\n\n<!-- Explains what the component is in one or two sentences. -->\n\n</PageDescription>\n\n<AnchorLinks>\n\n<AnchorLink>Overview</AnchorLink> <AnchorLink>Live demo</AnchorLink>\n<AnchorLink>Formatting</AnchorLink> <AnchorLink>Content</AnchorLink>\n<AnchorLink>Behaviors</AnchorLink> <AnchorLink>Modifiers</AnchorLink>\n<AnchorLink>Related</AnchorLink> <AnchorLink>References</AnchorLink>\n<AnchorLink>Feedback</AnchorLink>\n\n</AnchorLinks>\n\n## Overview\n\n<!--\nInclude a paragraph or two that describes the primary use cases for the component and details about how it helps the user achieve any tasks.\n\nExample:\n\n*The accordion component delivers large amounts of content in a small space through progressive disclosure. The header title give the user a high level overview of the content allowing the user to decide which sections to read.*\n-->\n\n### When to use\n\n<!--\nInclude examples for when to use this component and how it addresses the use case / solves a problem for the user.\n\nExample:\n\n*Dropdowns can be used in forms on full pages, in modals, or on side panels. The dropdown component is used to filter or sort contents on a page. It is a stylized version of the select component, and can be styled as needed.*\n-->\n\n### When not to use (optional)\n\n<!--\nIf there are two similar components that are used for different use cases, spell that out here and explain which component to use for each use case.\n\nExample:\n\n*It is best practice not to use a dropdown if there are two or fewer options to choose from. In this case, use a radio button group instead.*\n-->\n\n## Live demo\n\n<!--Include component demo here.-->\n\n## Formatting\n\n### Anatomy\n\n<!--The anatomy section has a set format and includes an example component with numbered callouts to each of the component elements. A list below provides the name of the element in bold and explains its purpose. Be sure to note if the element is optional.\n\nSee [Notification](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/components/notification/usage#anatomy) for an example.-->\n\n### Sizing (optional)\n\n<!--List out any component sizes that are available and provide some guidance about how to choose the best size for the use case. Other topics that may be covered here include considerations around maximum heights, maximum widths, and responsive resizing.\n\nExample:\n\n*There are four responsive modal sizes: xs, small, default, large. Choose a size that works best for the amount of modal content you have. Modals with short messages should use a xs or small modal to avoid long single lines; for complex components, like data table the default or large modal will be more accommodating.*\n-->\n\n### Alignment (optional)\n\n<!--\nConsider the relationship with other items that are the same. How do they sit in groups? What is their juxtaposition. For example:\n\n- Checkbox, radio button—what is their relationship horizontally and vertically?\n- Notifications—how do they stack?\n- Button—what happens when there's more than one?\n\nWe have some alignment content in the Structure section of the Style tab, so consider the relationship between the two tabs and include a cross-reference if necessary.\n\nExample:\n\n*Inside of a modal, body copy, including titles, have a 20% margin-right. However, form inputs and other components expand the full width of a modal window.*\n-->\n\n### Placement\n\n<!--\nDiscuss placement of the component in a broader context, that is:\n\n- alongside other components\n- within the grid\n\nYou may want to include a link here to the Structure section of the Style tab.\n\nExample:\n\n*Accordions can be placed with main page content or placed inside of a container such as a side panel or tile. When placing an accordion on the 2x Grid the indented title aligns to the grid columns and the top and bottom borders hang in the gutter.*\n-->\n\n## Content\n\n### Main elements\n\n<!--\nIdentify the content elements within the component, for example, title, label, placeholder text, links. Use H4s for the element names and provide guidelines underneath for each element.\n\nBriefly explain any particular rules such as phrase structure, word limits, and character limits. Where there's more than one rule, use bullets to list out the multiple rules for ease of reading. If necessary, refer out to main content guidelines for more detailed information, for example, capitalization, or recommended action labels.\n\nSee [Checkbox](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/components/checkbox/usage#content) and [Modal](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/components/modal/usage#content) for examples.\n-->\n\n### Overflow content\n\n<!--\nExplain how overflow content should be handled.\n\nExample:\n\n*When the accordion content is longer than the viewport the whole accordion should vertically scroll. Content should not scroll inside of an individual panel. Content should never scroll horizontally in an accordion.*\n-->\n\n### Further guidance\n\n<!--\nFor further content guidance, see Carbon's [content guidelines]([https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/guidelines/content/general](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/guidelines/content/general)).\n-->\n\n## Behaviors\n\n<!--\nDetermine which component behaviors apply to your component, and include from the following sections as needed.\n-->\n\n### States\n\n<!--\nIf including any information on this topic, include the following line:\n\nFor detailed visual information about the various states for this component, see the Style tab.\n\nExample:\n\n*The accordion component has two main states: collapsed and expanded. The chevron icon at the end of the accordion indicates which state the accordion is in. The chevron points down to indicate collapsed and up to indicate expanded.*\n-->\n\n### Interactions\n\n<!--\nInclude all possible interactions with the component, including:\n\n- Mouse\n- Keyboard\n- Screen readers\n\nSee [Accordion](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/components/accordion/usage#interactions) for an example.\n-->\n\n### Validation\n\n<!--\nInclude any guidelines for data validation and accompanying messaging. See [Form](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/components/form/usage/#validation-and-errors) for an example.\n-->\n\n### Responsive behavior\n\n<!--\nInclude details about how the component should behave in responsive situations.\n-->\n\n### Default selection\n\n<!--\nCover guidance around default settings and provide rationale.

Images should be accompanied by a descriptive caption and relate to the spec charts. Note we use the `image--fixed` markdown component in the Structure section to maintain size accuracy.\n\nVariants: You may need to provide additional specs for component variants like default versus flush alignment. For each variant, make a new h3 section and give it a name. The following are example pairs of section headers:\n\nDefault style text area structure\nFluid style text area structure\n\nDefault style text input structure\nFluid style text input structure\n\nDefault alignment structure\nFlush alignment structure\n\nModifiers: If you need to document additional ways of styling a component, add h3 sections under Structure as needed. Here are some example cases where a modifier section has been added:\n\n- adding an icon to a [button](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/components/button/usage/#variations)\n- adding a button to a [notification](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/components/notification/usage/#anatomy)\n- using high and low contrast styles for [notifications](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/components/notification/usage/#high-and-low-contrast)\n\nThe following content shows example documentation from [Accordion](https://carbondesignsystem.com/components/accordion/style), which has no variants and therefore does not need any h3 headers.\n-->\n\n| Element | Property    | px/rem   | Spacing token |\n| ------- | ----------- | -------- | ------------- |\n| Header  | height      | 40 / 2.5 | –             |\n| Item    | border-top  | 1        | –             |\n| Title   | margin-left | 16 / 1   | `$spacing-05` |\n\n<div className=\"image--fixed\">\n\n![Structure measurements for default accordion alignment](images/accordion-style-4.png)\n\n</div>\n\n<Caption>\n  Structure measurements for default accordion alignment. | px / rem\n</Caption>\n\n<br />\n\n<div className=\"image--fixed\">\n\n![Spacing measurements for default accordion alignment](images/accordion-style-5.png)\n\n</div>\n\n<Caption>\n  Spacing measurements for default accordion alignment. | px / rem\n</Caption>\n\n## Size\n\n<!--\nIn the size section, provide a table of component size names and height.

For example,\nif an accordion had a skeleton then you would name this section Skeleton.\n\nIf the component had a specific piece of functionality or behavior, like\nhow you can sort with a Data Table, then Sorting would be the name of this\nsection.\n\nThis section should include an explainer for the use-case and when to use it,\nalong with a code snippet that someone could bring into their project.\n-->\n\n## Component API\n\n### [Component name] props\n\n| Prop        | Type     | Required | Default | Description |\n| ----------- | -------- | -------- | ------- | ----------- |\n| `className` | `string` | –        | –       | –           |\n\n<!--\n* Only specific required as `true`, if it's false you don't need to indicate that\n* Specify the default value if applicable\n* Provide a description if applicable\n* Annotate the type using TypeScript type annotations\n* Empty cells should be filled with en dashes (–)\n* Table should be sorted in alphabetical order\n-->\n\n#### [Component name][prop name]\n\n<!--\nUsed to clarify prop usage, provide additional info or snippets\n-->\n\n## References\n\n<!--\nA place for references, links, or a way clarify points made earlier\nin the documentation.\n-->\n\n## Feedback\n\nHelp us improve this component by providing feedback, asking questions, and\nleaving any other comments on\n[GitHub](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon-website/issues/new?assignees=&labels=feedback&template=feedback.md).\n```\n\n### Accessibility template\n\nThe accessibility template helps designers and developers ensure components are\naccessible. The published information helps users understand all the\naccessibility considerations that are baked into Carbon. Refer to our guidance\non creating the\n[keyboard interaction visuals](https://github.com/hiraaeth/component-contribution-accessibility/wiki/High-fidelity-keyboard-interaction-visuals).\n\n```markdown\n---\ntitle: Component name (you won't need to write this)\ndescription: Component description (you won't need to write this)\ntabs: ['Usage', 'Style', 'Code', 'Accessibility']\n---\n\n<PageDescription>\n\n<!--\nThere are 2 stock page descriptions.\nChoose the first example if designers need to include annotations in their wireframes to make the component accessible. Choose the second if the component is accessible without additional design decisions.\n** If example 2 is used, the Design recommendations section and its anchor link should be removed.\n\nExample 1:\nDesign annotations are needed for specific instances shown below, but for the\nstandard [component_name] component, Carbon already incorporates accessibility.\n\nExample 2:\nNo accessibility annotations are needed for [component_name]s, but keep these considerations in\nmind if you are modifying Carbon or creating a custom component.\n-->\n\n</PageDescription>\n\n<AnchorLinks>\n  <AnchorLink>What Carbon provides</AnchorLink>\n  <!--\n  Only include Design recommendations if there are actually tasks for a designer to do\n  -->\n  <AnchorLink>Design recommendations</AnchorLink>\n  <AnchorLink>Development considerations</AnchorLink>\n</AnchorLinks>\n\n## What Carbon provides\n\nCarbon bakes keyboard operation into its components, improving the experience of\nblind users and others who operate via the keyboard. Carbon incorporates many\nother accessibility considerations, some of which are described below.\n\n### Keyboard interaction\n\n<!--\nThis keyboard section introduction text can give details of keyboard operation. For actionable components, begin by talking about the navigation via the tab stop, then discuss common interactions keys. For components with subcomponents, unless there is little interaction for the subcomponent, consider splitting the subcomponent considerations into a separate paragraph, separated by an illustration. Where operation is more complicated, separate headings for Keyboard navigation and Keyboard interaction can exist.Keyboard keys should be referred to with code styling.\n\nExample 1:\n-->\n\nEach accordion is a tab stop. `Space` or `Enter` keys expand or collapse\naccordions, which are collapsed by default. Interactive elements within expanded\naccordions integrate into the tab order automatically.\n\n<!--\nExample 2:\nEach page link in the breadcrumb is reached by `Tab` and activated by `Enter`. The current\npage, if listed in the breadcrumb, is not a link. If the breadcrumb is truncated, the ellipsis button\nfor the overflow menu is in the tab order. See [overflow menu]((https://carbondesignsystem.com/components/overflow-menu/usage/)) for details on its keyboard operation\n-->\n\n<!--\n**Images**\nUse one image to document keyboard navigation. If the component has limited operation functionality, it may also be incorporated in the same image. Otherwise, the operation should be dealt with in a separate image.\nNormally these images go across 8 columns.\nimages should follow the naming convention (component_name-accessibility-1.png\nThe ALT text text for the first image can be fairly generic, since the image is just restating information in the prior paragraph.\nThe caption should likewise summarize something already described in the preceding paragraph. No new information should be given in the caption. Due to technology constraints, keystroke names in the captions are not given any markdown styling.\nExample:\n![example of breadcrumb keyboard interaction](images/breadcrumb-accessibility-1.png)\n<Caption>\n  The breadcrumb's links are reached by Tab and activated by Enter.\n</Caption>\n-->\n<Row>\n<Column colLg={8}>\n\n![example of (componet_name) keyboard interaction](images/component_name-accessibility-1.png)\n\n<Caption>\n  The (component_name) is reached by Tab and activated by Enter.\n</Caption>\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\n<!--\nThe Design recommendations section should only be included if annotations are needed\n-->\n\n## Design recommendations\n\nDesign annotations are needed for the following instances.\n\n<!--\nSome of the possible subheadings here include:\n- headings\n- alignment\n- labeling\n- meaningful order\n\nEach should have a level 3 heading, a descriptive paragraph and a supporting image.\n\nExample:\n\n### Headings\nCarbon accordions are not set as headings by default. For improved accessibility, annotate accordions as headings on the first occurrence in a product. Annotate the heading level of accordions as needed.\n\n-->\n\n## Development considerations\n\nKeep these considerations in mind if you are modifying Carbon or creating a\ncustom component.\n\n<!--\nProvide a bulleted list of implementation considerations for ensuring accessibility. If there is the ability to refernce the IBM toolkit or the ARIA authoring practices, that should be done.\n\n- Use dashed bullets and ensure code is styled as code and consistently appears with the\nfollowing symbols: <element>, 'variable' and \"value\".\n- End each bulleted list item with a period.\n\nExample:\n- See the [ARIA authoring practices](https://w3c.github.io/aria-practices/#tooltip) for more considerations.\n\n-->\n```\n\n## Documenting patterns\n\nPatterns show reusable combinations of components and templates that address\ncommon user objectives with sequences and flows. Because they are more\ncomplicated than components, you may need to adjust the topic order to best tell\nthe story — but your pattern should cover all of the topics outlined in the\nfollowing templates.\n\n### Pattern template: for one variant\n\nUse this template for documenting patterns that have a single variant. You can\nsee this template in use for [Toolbar](/patterns/text-toolbar-pattern/).\n\n```markdown\n---\ntitle: Pattern name\ndescription: Explain the pattern in one or two sentences.\n---\n\n<PageDescription>\n\nExplain the pattern in one or two sentences.\n\n</PageDescription>\n\n<AnchorLinks>\n\n<AnchorLink>Overview</AnchorLink>  \n<AnchorLink>Designing with [pattern]</AnchorLink>  \n<AnchorLink>Accessibility</AnchorLink>  \n<AnchorLink>Related</AnchorLink>  \n<AnchorLink>References</AnchorLink>  \n<AnchorLink>Feedback</AnchorLink>\n\n</AnchorLinks>\n\n## Overview\n\nThis section answers the question: “What problem does this pattern solve?”\n\n- Define the use of your pattern and what it does.\n- Explain a user’s needs and how the pattern meets those needs.\n\n### Anatomy\n\nInclude an image with callouts explaining each part of the pattern. See the\n[Forms pattern](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/patterns/forms-pattern#anatomy-of-a-form)\nfor an example.\n\n### When to use\n\nInclude a short list describing situations where this pattern could be applied.\n\nFor example, use this pattern when:\n\n- Situation 1\n- Situation 2\n\n### When not to use (optional)\n\nIf required, include a short explanation about when not to use this pattern.\n\n## Designing with [pattern]\n\nThis section explains the pattern in detail. Use a combination of written\nexplanations and visuals to tell the story.\n\nDescribe the elements, components, and content that make up the pattern.\n\nShow the pattern in context. Use visuals throughout your written commentary to\nillustrate your guidance.\n\nDifferent patterns require different visuals to best explain the behaviors and\nhierarchy. Choose the options that make the most sense for the story you are\ntelling.\n\n- Use annotated wireframes or sketches to explain the visual hierarchy of\n  components.\n- Create high-level user flows to explain the big picture.\n- Create a functional prototype if that is the best way to illustrate the\n  pattern's behavior.\n\nProvide a Sketch file with any symbols you've created in the development of this\npattern.\n\nUse the following headings as guidelines for the kind of information to include.\nDepending on the requirements of your pattern, you may choose to present these\nheadings as H2 headings or as H3 headings underneath a more general \"Designing\nwith [pattern]\" heading. See the\n[Dialogs pattern](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/patterns/dialog-pattern/#designing-with-dialogs)\nas an example.\n\n### Types of [pattern]\n\nIf the pattern has different types or visual treatments that serve different use\ncases, cover them here and be sure to explain when to use each type.\n\nSee the\n[Empty states](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/patterns/empty-states-pattern#when-to-use)\npattern and the\n[Notification](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/patterns/notification-pattern#notification-types)\npattern for examples.\n\n### Behaviors\n\nDescribe behaviors, including guidance on interactions, and changes in states\nand content.\n\n### Best practices\n\nAre there any do's and don'ts specific to this variant? Include them here.\n\nFor examples of how to lay out this kind of information, see\n[Dropdown](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/components/dropdown/usage) and\n[Modal](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/components/modal/usage#variations).\n\n### Visual guidance\n\nCover any important topics such as alignment, image choice considerations, or\nspecial treatments in situations with no data or multiple instances of elements.\nSee the\n[Empty states pattern](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/patterns/empty-states-pattern#visual-guidelines-for-smaller-empty-spaces)\nand the\n[Forms pattern](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/patterns/forms-pattern#designing-a-form)\nfor examples.\n\n### Other use cases\n\nIf there are use cases that require a different solution, include those here\nwith corresponding explanations and visuals. Be sure to explain the reasons for\nusing one solution over another.\n\n## Accessibility\n\nEvaluate your pattern to ensure it meets\n[accessibility standards](notion://www.notion.so/guidelines/accessibility/overview)\nand guidelines, and provide details of compliance.\n\nFor example, “Users should be able to TAB into the input field of the search box\nto begin typing and press ENTER to run the search query.”\n\nFor examples, see the\n[Text toolbar pattern](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/patterns/text-toolbar-pattern#accessibility)\nand the\n[Search pattern](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/patterns/search-pattern#accessibility).\n\n## Related\n\nWhich components are used when building this pattern? Did you reference other\npatterns? List them here.\n\nIf necessary, clarify any differences between this pattern and related patterns.\n\n## References\n\nHelp designers understand your process by explaining your rationale for the way\nyou implemented the pattern. Include any research, citations, books or articles\nthat you found helpful.\n\n## Feedback\n\nHelp us improve this pattern by providing feedback, asking questions, and\nleaving any other comments on\n[GitHub](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon-website/issues/new?assignees=&labels=feedback&template=feedback.md).\n```\n\n### Pattern template: for multiple variants\n\nUse this template for documenting patterns that have multiple types or variants.\nYou can see this template in use for [Dialog](/patterns/dialog-pattern/) and\n[Loading](/patterns/loading-pattern/).\n\n```markdown\n---\ntitle: Pattern name (multiple variants)\ndescription: Explain the pattern in one or two sentences.\n---\n\n<PageDescription>\n\nExplain the pattern in one or two sentences.\n\n</PageDescription>\n\n<AnchorLinks>\n\n<AnchorLink>Overview</AnchorLink>  \n<AnchorLink>Designing with [pattern]</AnchorLink>  \n<AnchorLink>[Pattern] variant</AnchorLink>  \n<AnchorLink>Accessibility</AnchorLink>  \n<AnchorLink>Related</AnchorLink>  \n<AnchorLink>References</AnchorLink>  \n<AnchorLink>Feedback</AnchorLink>\n\n</AnchorLinks>\n\n## Overview\n\nInclude a paragraph or two that describes the primary use cases for the pattern\nand details about how it helps the user achieve any tasks.\n\nThe purpose of this overview section is to set context for your readers.\n\n### Anatomy\n\nIt can be helpful to show images of all of the variants in small form together.\nSee the\n[Dialogs pattern](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/patterns/dialog-pattern#modal-variants)\nand the\n[Notifications pattern](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/patterns/notification-pattern#notification-types)\nfor examples of this visual treatment.\n\nAlternatively, if there is one variant that includes common aspects of the\npattern that are seen across all or most variants, include an image with\ncallouts explaining each part of the pattern. See the\n[Forms pattern](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/patterns/forms-pattern#anatomy-of-a-form)\nfor an example.\n\n### [Pattern] variants\n\nInclude a table with the variants discussed in this pattern. Include a short\ndescription about the usage of each pattern variant. The table in\n[Modal component](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/components/modal/usage/#variants)\nis a good example of the level of detail required.\n\nThe variant names should link to the H2 headings for the variants below.\n\nAdd more columns, if needed. For example, you could add a column that includes\nshort explanations about when not to use the variant and guide the user to an\nalternative that may be more appropriate.\n\n## Designing with [pattern]\n\nThis section covers _universal_ content related to all variants, and depending\non the requirements of your pattern, may include the following H3s.\n\n### When to use\n\nIf you need to elaborate on the content included in the pattern variants table\nin the Overview, include that detail here. The\n[Notifications pattern](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/patterns/notification-pattern#when-to-use)\nis a good example of the kind of content to include.\n\n### When not to use (optional)\n\nIf required, include a short explanation about when not to use this pattern and\nprovide alternatives.\n\n### Universal behaviors\n\nDescribe any behaviors that are universal to all pattern variants, and include\nguidance on interactions, and changes in states and content.\n\n### Best practices\n\nList out best practices and include any design considerations that help with\nmaking choices.\n\n- Do's\n- Dont's\n\n### Visual guidance\n\nCover any important topics such as alignment, image choice considerations, or\nspecial treatments in situations with no data or multiple instances of elements.\nSee\n[Empty states](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/patterns/empty-states-pattern#visual-guidelines-for-smaller-empty-spaces)\nfor an example.\n\n### Other considerations\n\nIf there are any other considerations particular to your pattern that are\napplicable to all variants, include them here.\n\n## [Pattern] variant\n\nRename this H2 heading with the first pattern variant name, and repeat for all\nvariants within this pattern.

You can use the second person pronoun (\"you\").\n- Keep sentences and paragraphs short and focused.\n- Be clear and concise by removing unnecessary words. The more concise the text,\n  the easier it is for all users to understand.\n- Use sentence case for everything, including component names, e.g. Content\n  switcher and Data table.\n\n## Publishing updates\n\nReady to get your work reviewed and published? There are two ways to do this,\ndepending on your experience with GitHub. You may also draft your content and\nbring it to\n[office hours](https://ec.yourlearning.ibm.com/w3/series/10289694?layout=grid&_ga=2.129990351.257088430.1694013487-309583455.1691093939&_gl=1*16l2j5q*_ga*MzA5NTgzNDU1LjE2OTEwOTM5Mzk.*_ga_FYECCCS21D*MTY5NDAzMjgwMi4xMS4xLjE2OTQwMzQ0OTEuMC4wLjA.)\nto get further guidance.\n\n### Editing in browser\n\n#### How to edit an existing page\n\nIf you are editing an existing docs page, the easiest option is to click on the\n`Edit this page on GitHub` link that appears at the bottom of every page on the\nsite. The link opens the specific GitHub page where you can edit the content and\nthen propose the change with a pull request. Your changes will be reviewed by\nthe Carbon team. This is the easiest and most commonly used approach by\ncontributors.\n\n<Video\n  src=\"/videos/edit-this-page-contribution.mp4\"\n  poster=\"/videos/edit-this-page-contribution.png\"\n>\n  <track default srcLang=\"en\" title=\"How to edit an existing page\" />\n</Video>\n\n#### How to add a new page or image\n\nTo start, go to the Carbon website repository\n[here](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon-website). Navigate to the\nleft hand corner above the files and click `main`. From here, type in a new\nbranch name that reflects your work. For\nexample,`add-accordion-accessibility-guidance`. Once that new branch is created,\nnavigate to where the new file will be stored for a\n[component](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon-website/tree/main/src/pages/components)\nor\n[pattern](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon-website/tree/main/src/pages/patterns).\n\nEnsure you are in the branch you created, then navigate to `Add file` in the\nupper right-hand corner. To add a new guidance page, click `create new file`\nbutton. Title the file one of the following: `usage.mdx`, `style.mdx`,\n`code.mdx`, or `accessibility.mdx`. To add an image, make sure you are in the\nimage folder and click `Upload files`.\n\nAfter filling out the markdown template or adding an image, click\n`Commit changes`. Describe your work and double check that you are on the branch\nyou created. If you are in the wrong branch, you will have to copy your content\ninto the correct branch.\n\n<Video\n  src=\"/videos/inline-edit-contribution.mp4\"\n  poster=\"/videos/inline-edit-contribution.png\"\n>\n  <track default srcLang=\"en\" title=\"How to add a new page or image\" />\n</Video>\n\nOnce you have committed your changes, go to the\n[Pull requests](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon-website/pulls)\npage. Compare `base: main` to your branch and click `Create new pull request`.\nYour contribution will be reviewed by the Carbon team!\n\n### Editing in a local environment\n\nAlternatively, if you are planning regular or more comprehensive content updates\nand are up for a more advanced option, you'll want to fork the repo and install\nsome of the tools we use to build the website. This will create an easier\nworkflow for you long term, but takes some time to set up.\n\nIf you are familiar with this process, you can\n[fork the repo](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon-website/blob/main/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#submission-guidelines)\nand get started.
