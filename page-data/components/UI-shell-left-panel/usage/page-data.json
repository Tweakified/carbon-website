All three can be used\nindependently, but the components were designed to work together.\n\n| Shell UI component |                                                                                                                                         |\n| ------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| Header             | The highest level of navigation. The header can be used on its own for simple products or be used to trigger the left and right panels. |\n| Left panel         | An optional panel that is used for a product's navigation.                                                                              |\n| Right panel        | An optional panel that shows additional system level actions or content associated with a system icon in the header.                    |\n\n<Row>\n<Column colLg={8}>\n\n![UI shell components.](images/shell-usage-1.png)\n\n<Caption>UI shell components</Caption>\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\n## Anatomy\n\nThe left panel contains secondary navigation and is positioned below the header\nand fixed to the left.

Sub-menus are\ndenoted with a chevron and expand when clicked, pushing the other items down in\nthe panel. To collapse the sub-menu, the user must again click the menu header\nin the left panel.\n\nThe left panel does not support three tiers of navigation. If you have\nadditional content to display beneath a sub-menu, use tabs within the page.\n","type":"Mdx","contentDigest":"9fff2c14b801109bf73ce0b14ead1358","owner":"gatsby-plugin-mdx","counter":4574},"frontmatter":{"title":"UI shell left panel","description":"This left panel is part of the Carbon UI shell.
